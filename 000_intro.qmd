## Intro.: Computational Social Science

-   What is it?

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/edelmann.png)

"Computational social science is an interdisciplinary field that advances theories of human behavior by applying computational techniques to large datasets from social media sites, the Internet, or other digitized archives such as administrative records."

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

"\[CSS is\] the development and application of computational methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) behavioral data."
:::

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

Commonalities:

-   Computationally intensive methods

-   New types of data

-   Outcome of interest is ultimately human behaviour (?)

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

Tensions:

-   Place of theory

    -   Theory from data

    -   New data for old theories?

## Where has this all come from?

## Why are these data different?

1.  Volume
2.  Velocity
3.  Producers
4.  Variety

## Digital trace data

What is digital trace data?

-   Social media posts

-   Blogs and webpages

-   Call detail records (CDRs)

-   Web searches

-   Wearables

-   Internet of Things

## Digital trace data

What does it look like?
