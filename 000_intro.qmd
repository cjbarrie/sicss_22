## Intro.: Computational Social Science

-   What is it?

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/edelmann.png)

"Computational social science is an interdisciplinary field that advances theories of human behavior by applying computational techniques to large datasets from social media sites, the Internet, or other digitized archives such as administrative records."

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/cssobstacles.png)

"\[CSS is\] the development and application of computational methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) behavioral data."
:::

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

Commonalities:

-   Computationally intensive methods

-   New types of data

-   Outcome of interest is ultimately human behaviour (?)

## Intro.: Computational Social Science

Tensions:

-   Place of theory

    -   Theory from data

    -   New data for old theories?

## Where has this all come from?

## Why are these data different?

1.  Volume
2.  Velocity
3.  Producers
4.  Variety

## Digital trace data

What is digital trace data?

-   Social media posts

-   Blogs and webpages

-   Call detail records (CDRs)

-   Web searches

-   Wearables

-   Internet of Things

## Digital trace data

What does it look like?

## Isn't this all just a fad?

No

## Next question?

## But seriously...

-   Ubiquity
-   Diversity
-   Complementarity

## But seriously...

-   Ubiquity
    -   Digital trace data is everywhere and "always on"

## But seriously...

-   Diversity
    -   of methods and data sources means no-brainer to use

## But seriously...

-   Complementarity
    -   of data and methods means enrichment (of the old) not substitution (by the new)

## Isn't it all just \[stats./quant./data science\]?

-   In some ways: yeah...

## Isn't it all just \[stats./quant./data science\]?

:::

## Isn't it all just \[stats./quant./data science\]?

-   In some ways: yeah...

-   In other ways: well, no...

    -   New types of data

        -   e.g., unstructured and trace data
        -   associated decisions re how to restructure (compare: surveys)

## Isn't it all just \[stats./quant./data science\]?

-   In other ways: well, no...

    -   New emphasis

        -   e.g., learning from data and prediction

## Isn't it all just \[stats./quant./data science\]?

-   In other ways: well, no...

    -   New theory

        -   e.g., human-computer interaction

## Isn't it all just \[stats./quant./data science\]?

-   In other ways: well, no...

    -   New ethical dilemmas...

## Ethics

-   consequentialism
-   deontology

## How do we decide?

-   IRB (rules-based)
-   ethical judgment (principles-based)

...

-   and we do this *openly* (transparency-based accountability)

## Ethics

-   respect for persons
-   beneficence
-   justice
-   respect for law and public interest

## Ethics

-   respect for persons (Belmont)
-   beneficence (Belmont)
-   justice (Belmont)
-   respect for law and public interest (Menlo)

2.  <https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CSD-MenloPrinciplesCORE-20120803_1.pdf>

3.  <https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf>

## Ethics

-   respect for persons
    -   participants decide--not you (informed consent)

## Ethics

-   beneficence
    -   minimize risk and maximiize benefits to decide if worth it

    -   N.B. third-party oversight (because researcher bias)

## Ethics

-   justice

    -   distribution of benefits and burdens of research

        -   vulnerable individuals; global South as lab

## Ethics

-   respect for law and public interest

    -   compliance (TOS and general law...)
        -   N.B. difficulties with cross-national research
    -   be open about what you're doing (transparency-based accountability)

## Group work

-   Split into five groups
-   Each of you assigned one reading
    -   <https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320040111>

-   Think about the study as it relates to: respect for persons; beneficence; justice; respect for law and public interest

## What is at stake?
