## Introduction

-   Why get tweets?
    -   Testing API call (again...)

    -   We can investigate text beyond keywords

    -   We can investigate additional tweet characteristics (metrics, annotations)

    -   We can investigate user characteristics...

## Getting tweets

-   As barometer of public opinion

## Getting tweets

-   As barometer of public opinion
    -   Coverage?

## Getting tweets

-   As barometer of public opinion
    -   Bias?

## Getting tweets

-   As barometer of public opinion
    -   Advantages versus surveys?
        -   Real-time ("always on")

        -   More accurately/realistically measured (?)

## Sampling tweets

-   By keyword

## Geolocating tweets

-   By user-reported location

## Getting tweets

-   As measure of individual attitudes

## Sampling tweets

-   (Here) reliance on hacked lists
-   Continued streaming

## Sampling tweets

Design considerations:

-   Attrition via takedown
-   Tweet honesty?
-   Alternative sampling strategy?
-   Geolocation...

## Geolocating tweets

-   V small pct. of tweets are geolocated (.1--1%)
-   Have to rely on coarse-grained location
-   Or infer from "friends" (whom an individual follows)
    -   Blunt force: frequency of locations of friends network

    -   More precise: spatial label propagation

        -   Get location of friends

            -   Get locations of friends of friends...

        -   Predict user location from distribution

## Coding tweets

1.  Coding criteria
2.  MTurk
    1.  Use labels as outcome

    2.  Use to train supervised ML algorithm

## Getting tweets

-   As a measure of popularity/engagement

## Getting tweets

-   As a measure of popularity/engagement
    -   Accurate measure of human attention?
    -   Accurate measure of endorsement?

## Group work

1.  Replicate Flores (2017) using `get_all_tweets()` and another event of interest
2.  Formulate code needed to request that data
3.  (If access granted) make the API call to get data
4.  Consider limitations + design considerations
