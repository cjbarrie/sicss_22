## Introduction

-   Why get tweets?
    -   Testing API call (again...)

    -   We can investigate text beyond keywords

    -   We can investigate additional tweet characteristics (metrics, annotations)

    -   We can investigate user characteristics...

## Getting tweets

-   As barometer of public opinion
    -   Advantages versus surveys?
        -   Real-time ("always on")

## Group work

1.  Replicate Flores (2017) using `get_all_tweets()` and another event of interest
2.  Formulate code needed to request that data
3.  (If access granted) make the API call to get data
4.  Consider limitations + design considerations
