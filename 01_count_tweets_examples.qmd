## Introduction

-   Why count tweets?
    -   Test your API call

    -   **Of substantive interest**

        -   But... design considerations (normalizing)

## Counting tweets

-   As barometer of public opinion

## Counting tweets

-   As measure of issue salience

## Design considerations

-   Is this a barometer of *offline* opinion...?

## Design considerations

-   Is this an appropriate measure of issue salience?

    -   What % of MPs are on Twitter?

## Design considerations

-   Is this an appropriate measure of issue salience?

    -   What % of MPs are on Twitter?
    -   Answer: \~90% (see this [useful website](https://www.politics-social.com/))
        -   Coverage questions similar to survey design:

            -   Does my sample capture population of interest?

                -   What is the coverage?

                -   Is there temporal bias?

                -   Is there (equivalent) non-response?

## Design considerations

-   Is this an appropriate measure of issue salience?

    -   Does this capture online *and* offline dimensions?
        -   Is communication here domain-specific?

        -   How could we tell?

## Group work

1.  Come up with a question answerable using `get_tweet_counts()`
2.  Formulate code needed to request that data
3.  (If access granted) make the API call to get data
4.  Consider limitations + design considerations
    -   What bias might be built in?

    -   Does this illuminate dynamics outside online domain?

    -   What is the coverage like?
