## Introduction

-   What is an API?
-   `Counting tweets`
    -   Applied examples

    -   Group work
-   `Getting tweets`
    -   Applied examples

    -   Group work

## Analyzing Twitter data

Why?

1.  Important site of political communication
2.  Important site of social interaction
3.  It's very accessible

Especially, since intro. of **Academic Research Product Track**...

## Twitter Academic API

-   10m tweets monthly
-   Full historical archive
-   Authorization requires...

## Authorization

Go [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research)

1.  Do you have an academic profile?
2.  Can you describe your research?
    -   Will you share with government entity?
    -   Is the research non-commercial?
    -   Is it conducted at individual level?
    -   Will you make non-anon. data available?

## What you'll see

Or a live example...

## What you'll see

This is what the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) looks like

## Getting started...

![](images/TWITTER_BEARER.gif){fig-align="center"}

Don't forget to **Restart R**

## After we've done that...

We're good to go 🥳

## After we've done that...

We're good to go 🥳

But **before** we do that...

## What's an API anyway?

-   We're talking about *Web APIs*
-   "**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface"
-   Helpful to think about compared to scraping...

## Scraping Twitter

## Using the Twitter API

![](images/api.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Requesting versus scraping

-   **Scraping:**
    -   Extracts visible content from screen

    -   Often trial and error as not optimized for serving data ( legibility not readability)
-   **API calls**
    -   Requests content from a "blank" version of page

    -   Delivers data in more readily usable format (JSON, csv etc.)

## What does it look like?

-   Essentially, a long URL string...

```{r, echo = F}
endpoint_url <- "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all"
cat(endpoint_url, paste0("+ something + something else"))
```
## What is it made of?

1.  A query
2.  An endpoint
3.  Optional parameters

## What is it made of?

```{r, echo = T}

my_query <- "#BLM lang:EN"

endpoint_url <- "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all"

params <- list(
  "query" = my_query,
  "start_time" = "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_time" = "2021-07-31T23:59:59Z",
  "max_results" = 20
)

```

## What is it made of?

```{r, echo = T}

my_query <- "#BLM lang:EN"

endpoint_url <- "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all"

params <- list(
  "query" = my_query,
  "start_time" = "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_time" = "2021-07-31T23:59:59Z",
  "max_results" = 20
)

params

```

## But we don't often do this...

-   Pre-packaged libraries more common
    -   E.g., `academictwitteR`
        -   Co-developed with [Justin Ho](https://github.com/justinchuntingho) and [Chung-Hong Chan](https://github.com/chainsawriot)

![](images/athex.png){fig-align="right" width="300"}

## So what we'll do is ...

-   We'll focus on `academictwitteR`
-   But we'll also be thinking later more generally about:
    -   APIs

    -   research design
