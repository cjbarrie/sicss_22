## Introduction

-   What is an API?
-   `Counting tweets`
    -   Applied examples

    -   Group work
-   `Getting tweets`
    -   Applied examples

    -   Group work

## What is an API?

-   "Application Programming Interface"
    -   We'll focus on: Web APIs

## API use over time

## Early APIs

## Examples

-   **APIs used**: Google AdWords; Facebook Marketing
-   **Data and code**: <https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol43/27/>

## Examples

-   **APIs used**: YouTube API
-   **Data and code**: <https://github.com/kmunger/YT_descriptive>

## What's an API made of?

-   We're talking about *Web APIs*
-   "**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface"
-   Helpful to think about compared to scraping...

## Scraping Twitter

## Using the Twitter API

![](images/api.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Requesting versus scraping

-   **Scraping:**
    -   Extracts visible content from screen

    -   Often trial and error as not optimized for serving data ( legibility not readability)
-   **API calls**
    -   Requests content from a "blank" version of page

    -   Delivers data in more readily usable format (JSON, csv etc.)

## What does it look like?

-   Essentially, a long URL string...

```{r, echo = F}
endpoint_url <- "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all"
cat(endpoint_url, paste0("+ something + something else"))
```

## What is it made of?

1.  A query
2.  An endpoint
3.  Optional parameters

## What is it made of?

```{r, echo = T}

my_query <- "#BLM lang:EN"

endpoint_url <- "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all"

params <- list(
  "query" = my_query,
  "start_time" = "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_time" = "2021-07-31T23:59:59Z",
  "max_results" = 20
)

```

## What is it made of?

```{r, echo = T}

my_query <- "#BLM lang:EN"

endpoint_url <- "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/all"

params <- list(
  "query" = my_query,
  "start_time" = "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_time" = "2021-07-31T23:59:59Z",
  "max_results" = 20
)

params

```

## But we don't often do this...

-   Pre-packaged libraries more common
    -   E.g., `academictwitteR`
        -   Co-developed with [Justin Ho](https://github.com/justinchuntingho) and [Chung-Hong Chan](https://github.com/chainsawriot)

![](images/athex.png){fig-align="right" width="300"}

## So what we'll do is ...

-   We'll focus on `academictwitteR`
-   But we'll also be thinking later more generally about:
    -   APIs
    -   research design

## Analyzing Twitter data

Why?

1.  Important site of political communication
2.  Important site of social interaction
3.  It's very accessible

Especially, since intro. of **Academic Research Product Track**...

## Twitter Academic API

-   10m tweets monthly
-   Full historical archive
-   Authorization requires...

## Authorization

Go [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research)

1.  Do you have an academic profile?
2.  Can you describe your research?
    -   Will you share with government entity?
    -   Is the research non-commercial?
    -   Is it conducted at individual level?
    -   Will you make non-anon. data available?

## What you'll see

Or a live example...

## What you'll see

This is what the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) looks like

## Getting started...

![](images/TWITTER_BEARER.gif){fig-align="center"}

Don't forget to **Restart R**

## After we've done that...

We're good to go 🥳

## Ethical considerations

## Ethical considerations

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/bitbybit.png)

"I don't think researchers should not be automatically bound by such terms-of-service agreements. Ideally, if researchers violate terms- of-service agreements, they should explain their decision openly... as suggested by transparency-based accountability. But this openness may expose researchers to added legal risk..."

## Ethical considerations

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

""By employing TOS- compliant methods, you are respecting the business prerogatives of the company that created the platform you are studying, but you may or may not be respecting the dignity and privacy of the platform's users" "
:::

## Summary

-   Difference between TOS compliance and ethics
    -   But related: users expect privacy
-   Difference between ethics and legality
    -   But related: users may be vulnerable
