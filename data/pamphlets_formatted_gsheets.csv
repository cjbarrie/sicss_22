The Season of Anger Sets in Among the Arab Peoples,2011-03-30,2011,"The Season of Anger Sets in Among the Arab Peoples,,A member of the Algerian opposition warned the Arab rulers that the Tunisian revolution would initiate a revolutionary tsunami phenomenon that would sweep away their thrones. At the beginning of last December, the end of the dictatorial regimes began with successive protests against high prices in Algeria and Jordan. Then the Tunisian revolution demanded the fall of the regime. Algeria caught the ball of flames, and protests ignited again after having calmed for a time. Then after the Tunisian president was expelled, the revolution reached Egypt. And when Egyptians deposed Mubarak, the sparks proceeded to Algeria, Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, and then Libya.,,The issue is not one of infection; rather, the subjugated peoples discovered the potential of their own free will. The revolution in one country inspired the populations in other countries, for people imprison themselves in waiting, hoping and yearning, until their spirits emerge carrying the roar of anger that shakes thrones. Every population transfers the experience of other revolutions, borrowing their slogans—’the people want the fall of the regime,’ and ‘peaceful, peaceful’—and their tactics, like the Friday of Anger in Jordan and sit-ins held in major squares located in middle of the capital, such as Egypt’s Tahrir Square. Tunisian revolutionaries contacted Egyptians, providing them with some tactics to beat the regime’s machine, like spraying the windshields of armored cars with colors to paralyze and get the better of them.,,Beyond inspiration and transmitting experience, there is also solidarity, for the Tunisian revolution’s victory celebrations spread to Jordan and Egypt. And most of the Arab peoples participated in Egypt’s joy. There were many moving scenes, like the singing of the national anthem and the distribution of sweets and drinks in Jordan and Gaza in celebration of Mubarak’s deposal.,,However, the regimes that consolidate their interests over and against the people’s also rely on one another and exchange their experiences with oppression and harassment. And now confrontations are raging in Bahrain, Yemen, and Libya as mummified regimes committing increased acts of violence and brutal murder against the protesters. Just as Egypt’s extinct regime did, they use thugs with soft weaponry to transform the scene into bloody chaos. Meanwhile, Israel threatens chaos at the regional level in support of its spies, the Arab rulers, since the one who benefits most from the bowing down of the Arab peoples and their backwardness is none other than Israel.,,The solidarity and support of the Arab revolutions for each other is the destiny of the Arab region and the only way to protect the interests and wealth of its peoples. With the extinct regime issuing threats—as if from another world—that Omar Suleiman, Mubarak, or Ria and Sikina will return, the duty to protect our revolution has doubled. Our resistance won’t simply bring about complete, permanent victory for our own revolution; it will also support the revolutions of other populations who support us in turn. This is our duty and our destiny. For the populations who were long patient, the path of regression to what came before was no longer available. Their victory will soon be achieved through their resistance and free will.,,",Solidarity,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161341im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Revolution3b-e1307396170411.png,imgID1,"=Arrayformula(image(F2,2))"
The Most Important Workers’ Protests,2011-03-30,2011,"[Voice of the Revolution, #3, Page 2],The most important workers’ protests,,The strikes that the workers held on Wednesday and Thursday, February 9th and 10th, were the last nail in Mubarak’s coffin. The regime realized that these strikes had developed into a general strike that completely paralyzed the country, and it was not strong enough to punish everyone. Therefore it was decided that Mubarak would be sacrificed.,,After Mubarak’s removal, thousands of Egypt’s workers decided to move towards realizing the goals of freedom and social justice that the revolution championed. Thus we found large movements of workers demanding the alleviation of the suffering to which they had been exposed for decades. This suffering took many forms: low wages that sometimes did not exceed two hundred pounds per month, the “appointment” system under which the period of temporary work sometimes extended to twenty years, or else the overthrow of corrupt administrations, in which corrupt officials are paid tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands as the heads of most organizations and institutions, while most of the employees are paid merely hundreds of pounds.,,Fifteen thousand workers from the Public Transport Authority organized a sit-in in front of the Radio and Television Building demanding the resignation of the president of the Authority and a wage increase.,,Twenty thousand workers from the Egypt Textile Company in Mahalla al-Kubra organized a sit-in in which they demanded the resignation of the corrupt administration, the disbandment of the union, increased incentives, healthcare for workers, and the implementation of the court order to raise the minimum wage.,,Meanwhile, thousands of bank workers held a strike to demand the removal of corrupt officials and wage equality, and thousands of temporary gas workers organized a sit-in demanding the stabilization of temporary employment.,","Solidarity, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163619im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Revolution3b-e1307396170411.png,imgID2,

“Participate in Supporting the Egyptian Economy”,2011-03-28,2011,",Brothers and sisters—all people of Egypt,No doubt you have noticed the gravity of the negative effects on the Egyptian economy that have resulted from the economic halt in most sectors during the last few days due to the circumstances that the country is going through. This includes the Egyptian stock market, which has been adjourned several times guarding against a rush to sell precipitated by a fear of negative effects on the Egyptian economy.,If you knew that a rush to sell stocks could actually cause Egyptian stock indices to crash—which would in turn be reflected in the rest of the economic sectors—then you would realize how important it is that our proud people do everything possible to support the stock market so that we do not cause it to collapse. Therefore, we must support the national economy and prove to the whole world that our people will make economic collapse impossible, and that their patriotism and defense of their wealth is an example to be followed. With that, I invite you all to do the following:,Firstly: Advise everyone you know who owns stocks to not be afraid and rush to sell, because the truth is that we are progressing towards positive reforms and changes, recovery of lost funds, and many positive decisions. All these factors and others like them indicate that stock prices will rise and reap profits in the short term. So if you don’t plan on buying, don’t sell.,Secondly: Your purchase of stocks in the exchange now is an opportunity for profit, for the justifications I gave above. It is a national economic duty for all to create strong purchasing power that supports trading in the stock market at its beginning, so that it sparks the market to go up and gain profits.,An invitation to all groups of people to make a purchase of stocks of even the lowest amount (100 Egyptian pounds) per person. A number of individuals can apply in the name of one person if their financial ability is lower than that sum, and even one person out of 100 people each paying 1 pound can make a purchase.,Initiate this quickly and do not hesitate to head to a brokerage firm in the stock market. Bring with you your national identity card to open an account in stock market exchanges and to obtain a trading code in your name (this is a necessary step so that you can deal in buying and selling in the market.) Mention to them that you came to participate in an economic support campaign, and you will find that all brokerage firms and entities in the market will facilitate and assist you and welcome and thank you.,Your initiative to participate is not only supportive, but it also affects the outset of the Egyptian stock market after the Revolution, creating a strong starting point which will dazzle us. We will rise from the first economic indicator that props us up economically before the world, and confidence and capital to invest in our homeland of Egypt will return.,",Culture,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160808im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Economic-Support.png,imgID8,
Glaring Contradictions in the Failed Amendments to the Constitution,2011-03-28,2011,",The text of Article 77, after the amendments, conflicts with Article 190 of the Constitution, which will not be amended. The text of Article 77, after amending, is as follows:,“The length of the presidency shall be four years (according to the Christian calendar), beginning with the announcement of election results. One may only be elected President of the Republic twice.”,Whereas Article 190 of the Constitution states:,“The period of the current Presidency of the Republic ends at the expiry of six years from the date of the announcement of the election results for President to the Republic.”,There is an inconsistency between the two Articles.,There is a conflict in the legal or constitutional Article regarding the Presidency of the Republic. Is the period 4 years or 6 years? The problem with this is that the newly-elected President may act in accordance with the second article and remain in power 6 years as if Article 77 was never amended.,Article 78 of the Constitution states:,“Procedures for choosing the new President shall begin 60 days before the end of the current Presidential term and must be completed at least one week prior to the end of the current term. If the selection of a new President is not completed within this time-frame, for whatever reason, the former President shall continue directing Presidential functions until his successor is selected. If the election of the new President is announced prior to the end of the previous term, the Presidential term begins the day after the end of the previous term.,The danger of this Article is [clear] when we draw a connection between it and Articles 77 and 190. [It] regards the lack of a deliberate intention or transparency [in them]. We are not reassured by the various scenarios and plans which have been offered as a distraction for the people and particularly for the youth.,[This is] due to the fact that Article 78 provides situations which leave the door wide open for the President to continue governing and directing the functions of his position, usurping power, and imposing himself on the nation by devising any grounds necessary, fabricating problems, and inventing crises, as happened during the previous presidency:,It is clear that Article 78 stipulates that: “If this period ends without the selection of a new president having been completed for any reason, the former president shall continue directing presidential functions until his successor is selected.” The statement “for any reason” should be deleted and replaced with “if necessary”.,Amended Article 148 states:,“The President of the Republic may announce a state of emergency as stipulated by the law. He must present this announcement to the People’s Assembly during the seven days prior [to its enactment] in order that it decide on the matter.,If the announcement is made when the Assembly is not convened, the Assembly shall be convened immediately in order that the announcement be presented to it, taking into account the time limit established in the previous paragraph.,If the Assembly has been dissolved, the matter shall be presented to the new Assembly during its first meeting and the members of the People’s Assembly must agree on announcing the state of emergency for a time period not to exceed six months. It shall not be extended except by a referendum of the people agreeing on such an extension.”,If we are currently facing an ongoing controversy with a foreign state attacking Egyptian land, should the President wait for a popular referendum—all the way from Alexandria to Aswan—to get the people’s opinion? Or [should he] govern the people by taking up the measures and necessary actions to hold off this hostility? Here, I say he should govern the people, instead of the president being restricted by the outcome of a referendum.,I think that the paragraph regarding the popular referendum in this Article distracts the people from the flaws which are connected to the constitution and its amendments in order to make the Egyptian people happy that they will be consulted, and their opinion and rule on everything will be followed. It is critical to get the people’s opinion on a Vice President, whom the people elect, not for the president to impose a Vice President on the people to govern them. This returns us to the handing over of power without the people noticing it.,Whereas Article 139 states:,“The President of the Republic must appoint, within his first 60 days of directing the function of his position, one Vice President or more and limit his/their jurisdiction. If the situation requires the Vice President’s dismissal, the President must appoint another one.,The conditions of duty made incumbent upon the President and the organizational rules for his support also apply to the Vice President.”,In every presidential democratic regime, the Vice President of the Republic is elected and not appointed, so that he—that is, the Vice President—can possibly become, in some circumstances, the President of the Republic through nomination. As far as this goes, this Article has passed over the people in the matter of choice or election of its president. This is inconsistent with the simplest principles of justice and democracy, yet this Article enshrines the principle of bestowing authority time and again.,Then, we come to the text of Article 179 which states:,“The President of the Republic, after the agreement of the Cabinet and half the members of the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council, can demand the drafting of a new constitution. [He can] establish a committee of 100 members who are chosen by a majority of the two Houses of Parliament. [Those nominated to the committee] are excluded from this vote. [They] will draft the constitution jointly within a period of 6 months from the date of its formation. The President of the Republic shall then call for a referendum of the people on the draft 15 days from the date of completion of the new constitution.”,The danger of Article 189 is that it does not call for nor oblige either the President of the Republic or the People’s Assembly to form a new constitution, nor does it require both the President and the Assembly to put in place a new constitution.,Additionally, the Article does not outline a deterrent penalty if either the President of the Republic or the members of the People’s Assembly give up or collude in consenting to the current constitution and do not draft a new one.,Whereas this Article creates a right for both the President and the People’s Assembly to draft a new constitution, there is a great difference between “right,” “duty,” and “obligation”. A “right” is something one is permitted to exercise or not exercise whereas a “duty” is an “obligation” for a person to undertake some specific task.,This proves the bad intention of [those] drafting this Article as far as what was mentioned previously. If the direction was explicit and clear toward drafting a new constitution, then the Article should begin with a statement obliging the President of the Republic to a duty… or committing the President of the Republic… something to confirm the political will toward a referendum on the current constitution as it is following the amendments. This is a dangerous matter which reflects a huge setback for the revolution, returning us to a regime worse than the one previous to the 25 of January 2011.,On the other hand, this text replaces the [authority] of the people with [that of] the members of the drafting committee, whereas the people are not able to choose the members of the drafting committee. This is a phenomenon of dictatorship which contradicts the principles of justice and democracy, following the old method while imposing trusteeship and hegemony over the people.,Article 189, Repeated (A),Why is the Shura Council to stay even though they are neither making progress nor postponing it? They are costing the state huge amounts of money, [money] which should provide public benefit and of which the poor are in need.,Or, has this Council adjusted the rules to appease some [political] personalities at the expense of the public treasury?,Article 75,This article has been tailored to exclude rational and practical expertise found among the Egyptian people so as to not benefit from its wide amount of learning from outside the country and across the world. These experts would be very beneficial as far as their competency and inventions. It would form a civilizational and qualificational leap forward for the country.,,Therefore I recommend refusing the amendments and the constitution as a whole.,Choose a drafting committee to present a parliamentary constitution like the constitution of 1923.,Abolish the Shura Council,,Muhammad Sayyid al-Sa‘idi,Appeals Lawyer,[phone number redacted],","Constitution, March Referendum",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161650im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/GlaringContradictionsInTheAmendments.png,imgID9,
The January 25th Egyptian Renaissance Party: “The Revolution is in Danger”,2011-03-28,2011,"Egypt has, in the past days, gone through a vexing time in its history, and it is testing the credibility of the sons of the revolution and those who believe in it or of those who used and exploited it. The call went out: “Do you support the extension of the absolute powers of the next president of the republic, giving him the same powers as the previous president, or do you support changing the Constitution and reducing the powers of the next president? This was among the most fundamental and basic goals of the revolution, that millions of Egyptians went out to support. However, everyone is surprised to see that matters are headed in the direction of “Are you with Islam, or against Islam?” The fatwa has entered the dialogue from the minbar. Men of religion have issued fatwas to say “yes”, and to forbid saying “no” while at the same time the sons of the revolution have prohibited the calls for, or distribution of, statements which say “no.”,The most dangerous incident occurred at the committees. There are those who stand before the committees, and sometimes within them, who say “For God’s sake, and for the sake of Islam, say yes, my brother.” The Shura Council is comprised of Mubarak’s “clergy” who defended him, condemned going out against him, forbade the demonstrations, and did not recognize the martyrs. Now they deny this, and they have befriended some of those from among our companions in the revolution. Where is the Military Council in all this? We demand that if the mosques are going to use calls for factious thought when entering into politics, then why not divide the mosques and give each political faction a number of mosques to use so that there are equal opportunities or ban those who are using the mosques and return them to the state’s control once again? We are the sons of the revolution. We do not recognize these misguided outcomes, we tightly adhere to our demands, we will not admit that they have defeated the revolution or the Egyptian people, and we caution against the upcoming electoral options being either saying “yes” to Islam or saying “no” to heresy.,They imagine those who oppose them to be the party that lost its way, whereas they themselves are in fact the lost party. We reject decisions which ban demonstrations and sit-ins and the fines for these strict provisions. We maintain that we and the Egyptian people have the right to peaceful demonstrations as long as our demands have not been met, and they are:,1. Announcing the names of those arrested and specifying a timetable for their release.,2. Changing the constitution, not amending it, and reducing the powers of the President of the Republic.,3. Dissolving the National Democratic Party (NDP), and distributing its headquarters among all of the parties, both new and old.,4. Delaying the People’s Assembly elections until after the presidential elections to give the revolutionary youth time to form parties in order to participate in the elections.,5. Rescuing and bringing back the Egyptians in Libya. We proclaim that we support the revolution in Libya and all of the revolutions in the Arab world.,6. Holding people accountable for burning files and quickly reclaiming the looted treasures from all of the corrupt, including the Mubarak family.,7. Putting on trial the policemen involved in causing the death of revolutionaries.,8. Preferring that those who know the law take the place of the police should they decide not to return to their positions.,9.

Urgent Announcement from Participants in the Tahrir Sit-in-Written in the Martyrs’ Blood,2011-03-26,2011,",,We are those sitting-in at Tahrir square who have been exposed to successive waves of violent attacks ever since February 26, 2011. These included suppression of the participants in Tahrir Square by groups of thugs bearing knives, Molotov cocktails, sticks, and clubs. They used all of these to attack the sit-in participants in order to reign in the Egyptian revolution that called for freedom, dignity, and social justice and in order to prevent the realization of its goals. The most recent of these waves came on March 9, 2011, beginning at twelve noon with hundreds of thugs. They were attempting to confront the participants with a group identifiable as state security personnel, which proceeded from ‘Abd al-Min‘am Riyad Square and Tal‘at Harb Square. Even so, it became clear that the army was protecting these groups, as they beat up participants, suppressed, tortured, and arrested dozens of them in the square and detained them in the Egyptian Museum, all under the supervision of the Armed Forces. In addition, the groups dragged the participants into conditions not befitting them as humans or as Egyptians. This confirms that the Egyptian Revolution is a target and there are intended attempts to abort the revolution and to separate it from its goals. Therefore we, children of the revolution—sitting-in and imprisoned in Tahrir Square—declare that the revolution continues until all its goals have materialized and until the nation is cleansed of all flaws, not solely corruption. We will not allow the return of any form, or even any part or symbol, of the toppled regime, scourging with an iron hand corruption, injustice, and authoritarianism. We declare that the revolution’s demands are as they were from the beginning:,We direct the message to the Higher Council of Armed Forces that the army’s duty is the protection of the revolution………..Has the military council arrived………..??????????,We also welcome all opinions that serve the revolution and the people of Egypt. We offer ourselves in service to our nation to facilitate communication. Follow us on the Tahrir sit-in website.,,Signed,Tahrir Square Sit-in Participants,,[Slogans in large typeface surrounding main text:],[Left side from top to bottom:],May God take note and give us justice.,The revolution will never get lost.,[Right side:],National unity,[Bottom of page:],Together for Egypt,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161333im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/UrgentAnnouncementFromtheSitin.png,imgID12,
"If, one day, the people want to live…",2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 4],If, one day, the people want to live…,Many people were throwing words around and saying that the Egyptian people are “a cowardly people… a people that gets nothing but whip lashes, a servile people, unable to revolt.” One of the opposition writers said, “Every day, sewer pipes explode. As for the Egyptian people, well they don’t and they won’t…” Once, on the closing day of the National Party Conference, one of the newspapers said right on its front page, in the top headline, “The Conference is Done, the People are Done For.”,None of them noticed that the Egyptian people, like all other peoples, revolt when the reasons for revolution are abundant, nor that there is not one people in the world characterized by cowardice and submission. Revolution is a group action and a collective will. The Egyptian masses swept away the mighty apparatus of oppression in its entirety —the State Security Investigation Service, the Central Security Forces, the Special Military Forces, the National Party’s thugs—during the days of the Tahrir sit-in and protests in the provinces. When millions marched on the ‘Uruba and Ras al-Tin Palaces and on the radio and television buildings in Cairo and Alexandria, it was shown that Mubarak and his entourage were actually paper tigers, a weak cardboard carton. There were millions from the Egyptian masses talking about politics prior to January 25th,2011. These discussions went on inside houses, cafes, buses, and on terraces. The people were speaking more profoundly than the politicians were. However, the masses were going no further than talking. Their conversations served as a beginning. There were strikes and demonstrations of workers and employees since 2006, until January 25th plowed up the earth and brought fourth economic gains as well as the right to effectively strike, to sit-in, and to protest. There were some sectors from among the public moving to establish independent unions. All of these movements were steps leading to breaking the barrier of fear put forward by the arsenal of repression.,At the same time, the spark of January 25th—which the youth movement had started within the masses of the Egyptian people—began. The masses found before themselves particular, substantive, and well-suited conditions for revolutionary action. Millions responded to the intifada and changed it into a revolution. Prior to Mubarak’s second speech, on Wednesday, February 9th, workers had brought their strikes and sit-ins to Tahrir Square, which made the balance of power tip towards the decisive moment. On February 11th, when millions had gone out into the all the streets of Egypt, it was possible for the Egyptian people to depose the dictator, Mubarak.,There are still many steps in front of the Egyptian people along the way towards completing its revolution. The revolution’s slogans remain: “Freedom, Social Justice, and the Civil State.” They are in need of an organized mass movement in order to bring them to fruition—a popular movement which destroys the corners and foundations of the regime, paving the way to rebuilding on the bases of justice, freedom, and equality.,If, one day, the people want to live, then they must complete the revolution.,",Solidarity,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165920im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID13,
My Son is a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 3],My Son is a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution,These many millions who gathered several times in Tahrir Square until the fall of the tyrant Mubarak are rooted in the popular neighborhoods and the other governorates outside Cairo. Many of them are members of professional and workers’ unions, workers in factories and companies, officials in departments and agencies, and students in Egypt’s universities. They are the only ones who can guarantee that the revolution’s demands will be met. Without them, Mubarak would not have left, and without them, we will not achieve what remains for the revolution to do. The regime is still standing, though some of its figureheads have been removed and brought to trial—Habib al-’Adili, Ahmad ‘Izz, Mubarak, and others from among the corrupt are out there in every neighborhood, every governorate, at the head of every governmental service, and in the administration of every single state institution. They are the guardians of corruption whom we must remove from their positions in order to purify Egypt. We have to pursue the police officers who took part in the torture of citizens in the police departments that protect the neighborhoods and regions in which we live. We must knock on neighbors’ doors and collect the names of unemployed youths so that we can create unions for the unemployed, demanding the provision of work opportunities or the disbursement of unemployment allowances for every youth without a job. We must prepare to run our youths as candidates in the elections for the Local Councils and not leave them to the National Party, which destroyed the country during the years of the deposed President Mubarak’s rule and made these Councils a den of corruption and the corrupt.,Our revolution is not yet finished. The road before us—toward realizing the aspirations of our people for a free and dignified life in every meaning of these word—is a long one. We will not leave the streets again. We will stay vigilant in confronting all types of injustice and tyranny. We will not let them return again. This country is ours; the government and the regime are made up of officials whose salaries we pay from our own, that they might organize the work of state institutions, not oppress and humiliate us. The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are a starting point for creating permanent popular supervision over the work of the government, to counter its deviations and guarantee that it takes on the responsibility of serving the citizenry, not robbing from and marginalizing them.,",Solidarity,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165925im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID14,
The Workers Want to Topple the Power of the Rich,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 3],The Workers Want to Topple the Power of the Rich,“The power of the rich is a solid, secure base. Replacing any of its people, or overthrowing some of its figureheads, or even the parties themselves, does not affect the strength of this power or cause it to disappear. It is not even disturbed by such changes, and can reconfigure its political system, which only defends the interests of the rich. It can even rebuild and reorganize the security apparatus to suppress any attempts to overthrow it.”,Achieving the completion of the revolution—“the people want to overthrow the regime”—requires not only toppling the head of the regime and some of its figureheads, along with dissolving its representative institutions—“the People’s Assembly, the Shura Council”—and snatching up some democratic demands. It also requires stripping the police, “the tool of the oppressive regime,” of their political functions. This happens when all the apparatuses and departments that oppressed the masses for decades are dissolved, and those who took part in this oppression in any way, especially the “State Security and Central Security Forces,” are tried. It also requires the repeal of all financial and political privileges for senior civil servants, army generals, and the police. Additionally, an election should be held, and all officials in the state and its institutions removed. The regime’s figureheads, along with their followers and those that benefited from the regime, should be stripped of “their riches” and tried by the masses for their corruption.,It was the workers who struggled for decades against this regime’s corruption, tyranny, and injustice. It is they who have risen up and expanded their protests since 2006, exposing the violations committed by the ruling power, capitalism, and their intertwined interests. In turn, because the Egyptian working class joined the revolution with the weapon of the strike after having entered it through use of the protest at its beginning, they empowered the revolution and pushed it to take great strides forward, creating a magnificent, revolutionary situation in which it became impossible for Mubarak to stay in the seat of power. His decision to step down came quickly after. Following the fall of the regime’s head, the workers’ strikes and sit-ins began escalating and growing in order to establish their particular social “class” demands after having withdrawn from the square’s demands, in addition to the programs, plans, and slogans of the political powers. The official media, “Mubarak’s media,” some of the political powers, and military statements have come out against the workers to warn them of the danger of strikes with respect to “the national economy.” They are demanding that workers refrain from exercising the right to strike, a right which they attained through physical sacrifice during the many years of Mubarak’s rule.,A revolution that takes away the right of the workers to strike is not a revolution. As concerns the powers who are demanding that workers refrain from using this weapon, they are, in reality, servants of stability and the continuation of the old regime, and they strike the prospect of revolution’s continuation at its heart.,The working class is able to overthrow the regime by way of striking at the power of the rich that Mubarak and his businessmen created in every area of the country. It is able to destroy the monopoly and cut off the heads of corruption.,Is it not within workers’ rights to purify their elected and service institutions of the criminals who follow Mubarak? Is it not their right to demand the realization of social justice, a “slogan of the revolution,” which Egypt has not had for decades now?,We must learn from the experience of the workers in Ghazal al-Mahalla, who overthrew the Commissioner of that corrupt company and chose a new one from among themselves to administer it; we must do the same everywhere. If we really want the fall of the regime, let us replace all the figureheads with someone else.,Long live the workers’ struggle, the beating heart of the revolution,","Solidarity, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162440im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID15,
There is No Democracy without Social Justice,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 3],There is No Democracy without Social Justice,We all know that the most common forms of election fraud are vote-buying and exchanging incentives with government officials, piling them into governmental buses and bringing them to vote in the interest of the National Party’s candidates. Additionally, we all also know that the easiest way to bypass standing in a queue in front of one of the governmental departments in order to get something taken care of is to pay a “tip” (a bribe) to the responsible official. To avoid a traffic violation, which might be as much as one hundred pounds, you just have to pay ten pounds to the traffic cop. All of these images are the manifestations of tyranny, corruption, and a lack of democracy. It is not that we are psychologically ill or love corruption or those that make us go along with it. Rather, it is a natural result of the lack of justice in the distribution of society’s wealth among the citizens. The corrupt official who takes a few pounds from you to finish up your business more quickly sees his bosses charge exponentially in comparison to what he does. If his bribe is a few pounds, then his bosses’ bribes are in the thousands or sometimes millions. Therefore, it is not possible for you to ask him to be honorable when he cannot provide for his family. It is the same with the person who sells his vote in the elections to the highest bidder and humiliates himself in order to provide another meal for his family. If there were enough for him and his needs were met, then he would not be forced to give up faith in himself. This explains why democracy cannot be realized without social justice. Disbanding the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council, overturning the State of Emergency, and holding new elections will be futile as long as there are only a handful of people who own the wealth and the power, enjoying the blessing of life while there are millions of hungry mouths that do not have their daily bread and suffer a deprivation that those who have money would not be able to bear for even a day.,We must fight for social justice, a minimum wage proportional to prices, the right to a good education for all citizens without discrimination, the right to assume public office for all youths, the right to housing for all citizens, and free treatment for all who suffer from illness. If these demands are not met, nothing will change. Instead, there will only be superficial reforms from which the normal citizen, he who holds the right to every inch of this country, will not benefit.,","Politics, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164407im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID16,
A Tale from the Curfew,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 2],A Tale from the Curfew,The day that Mubarak stepped down from rule, the streets filled with rejoicing and revelers. Several days later, I, along with a group of my friends, decided to have a special party, and we all met up at one of our friend’s places. We all got there the usual ways, since we don’t have cars to get around in. The time flew by in an atmosphere of boisterous joy. We chanted nationalistic songs which flared our enthusiasm and our love for our dear Egypt until one of us called out: “Its twelve-thirty!” Worry began to cloud the purity of our joy and we all immediately got ready to go, asking about the ways to get back to our houses. We flew out into the street in a desperate attempt to find a taxi to take us to our houses. During our search, a number of soldiers from the Military Police, who were all over the area in which my friend lives, stopped us. They insisted on searching our bags and asked us the reason we were in the street at such an hour.,One of my friends kept telling them all about our party, but they didn’t listen to what he was saying and started to search us all. This increased the worry and nervousness which had by then moved on to our children, who don’t know the meaning the word “curfew”. My daughter asked me, “Didn’t Hosni Mubarak leave? Why don’t they want us to walk as we like in the street?” I didn’t answer her question. All I could think about was ending the unjustified siege which had surrounded us, despite the fact that our appearance didn’t make it look like we were breaking the law. I kept nervously looking for a way to quickly get to the house as joy had completely evaporated from my heart. Worry, accompanied by questions about what would happen in the coming days, had taken its place—questions about the necessity of this silly curfew which resembles a violation of people’s freedom to move when and where they like.,","Military, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144705im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID17,
Details of the Revolution from Tahrir Square,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 2],Details of the Revolution from Tahrir Square,Eighteen days—the time of the sit-in in Tahrir Square—changed the face of history. There were not many optimists who expected the Egyptian people to be able to undertake their revolution with this amount of preparation, resistance, and awareness. I was honored to live this experience day after day and to witness the course of these days. The details were even more surprising. I am assuming that everyone followed the general events over the television screen and newspaper pages day after day. However, what I will try to get across to you are the details which led to this wonderful epic.,The square was the focal point of those who dreamt of freedom everywhere in Egypt. One morning, I saw a man and woman along with their three children. They seemed like they were from the farthest parts of Upper Egypt due to their accent and their white-cotton clothes. This was the day after the Battle of the Camels. The man was loudly screaming, “We’ve come from Suhaj so that we can die with you. Tell Mubarak that me and my family came of our own volition to die with the honorable ones. It’s like we’ve been dead anyway under his thirty years of rule!” The scene of them entering the square was absolutely fantastic.,The authorities cut off all the direct-broadcast feeds from Tahrir Square; everyone could feel the danger. This happened at the same time as the arrests of a large group of activists, including the storming of the Hisham Mubarak Center of Law along with the arrest of all the workers there. Thus the flow to the Square was even bigger the next morning. On that day, thugs prevented supplies from reaching the Square, whether it was medicine, food, blankets for keeping warm, or even bottles of water for drinking. I collected up some money from my colleagues to buy ful and ta‘miyya sandwiches to feed a large number of people. Looking at the meager amount we had gotten, we went to a restaurant and ordered 100 ful sandwiches and 100 ta‘miyya sandwiches. The owner of the restaurant asked us if the food was for the revolutionaries in the Square. When I told him yes, he started wishing us all success, and he insisted that he double the order to show his support for the sit-in. He added, “I’ll throw in the pickles for free.” He assured me that this contribution of his was no trouble at all since it was for those struggling to create a better future for him and his children.,Another scene which carries a lot of meaning was that of a Christian boy pouring water for a man with a large beard to do ablutions before the dawn prayer. At that time, I felt the depth of the feelings which had gathered up among all those who were in the Square—as if they were one big family, its individual members not paying any attention to the differences among them. It made them forget their ideological and religious affiliations and even made the differences between men and women vanish. Everyone forgot everything else, recognizing only that they were all Egyptians.,","Logistics, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144658im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID18,
Overthrowing the Arabian Giant: the Arab Peoples Revolt against Tyrants,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 2],Overthrowing the Arabian Giant: the Arab Peoples Revolt against Tyrants,The Tunisian people revolted and overthrew the dictator Ben ‘Ali, then the Egyptian people revolted and overthrew Mubarak. The revolutions of the Arab peoples are continuing in order to get rid of the corrupt regimes that govern them. Hence, the Libyan people’s revolution exploded against the tyrant Qaddafi, who used the most heinous and obscene methods to suppress their revolution.,The day in which the word of the Arab peoples—from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf—joins together has come. This time it is not in speeches, songs, nor with the handshakes of parade marshals. Instead, it is with the revolution. Its sun has risen to disperse the darkness and the cold of the past decades.,The revolution was not born in a single moment. Rather, social movements spread across Arab countries during the past years among the white- and blue-collar ranks and the racial and religious minorities who suffered persecution. These movements rose up in all the Arab countries, even though the details differed along with the forms of protest. We even witnessed them revolt in the Gulf countries, where we did not expect popular movements. They moved without being divided up by tribal, sectarian, and racial differences, which their regimes worked to fuel in order to protect their power.,The revolutions did not move about among the Arab peoples because of Al-Jazeera’s instigation —although we respect its position—or because of Facebook, as government media claimed. The Arab peoples revolted against regimes that exercised the most severe forms of exploitation against their peoples. They exploited the natural wealth of the country for the benefit of international corporations while granting immunity to those who benefitted from this. The regimes forbid the rights of expression and of forming parties and unions. The regimes groveled at the feet of the colonizers and stood before them like mice while facing their own peoples with masks of lions.,The knights of the Arab street lifted up the banners of justice and freedom and unsheathed determined swords. At the same time, the Arab rulers insisted on being stubborn and insolent as some of them strove to circumvent and attempted to deceive their people. However, they all followed the path of “the deposed Ben ‘Ali and Mubarak”. As for the Arab peoples, they fired a “heavy blow of clarity”, and they will not deceive them as the tongues accustomed to lying return. Rifles held in trembling hands will not scare them—nor the American support which reared our rulers in “its den”.,Arab regimes supported each other and gained power from colonial regimes. This is a signal to the revolutionary peoples to connect their struggles and unify their lines without looking to race, religion, color, or language. They will not be unified with the agreements and conglomerates of the regimes, but rather with the repressed peoples and the unity of their struggle.,","Libya, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153353im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID19,
Beware of the Counter-Revolution,2011-03-25,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 1],Speaking of the counter-revolution is now no longer an exaggeration or undermining of the Egyptian people’s unprecedented achievement with this great revolution which has taken the whole world by surprise. Counter-revolutions inevitably follow popular revolutions seeking justice, freedom and equality just as they calm down to catch their breath.,The popular Egyptian revolution has achieved its first goal of toppling the tyrant who controlled power for thirty years. But this is only the top of the pyramid, and the task of destroying the large base that he was leaning on remains. Our revolution now is against the heirs and successors of Mubarak everywhere, those who want to reverse things to where they were prior to the 25th of January. Their plans are becoming very obvious: Ahmad Shafiq (who was appointed by Mubarak) is still heading the government. This is the man who mocked the revolution by saying that he was ready to distribute candy to Tahrir protesters because for them it was just a fun outing. How could we believe that Shafiq and his appointed ministers would honor the legitimate demands of the Egyptian people?? This is the man who idly watched the massacre of Bloody Wednesday in Tahrir Square, then announced that he did not know about it!! How can we trust those who swore an oath of loyalty to Mubarak??,Until now, their corrupt and despicable media has attempted to describe the revolution as a “youth revolution,” as if it were not a revolution of the whole population with all of its groups: men and women, elderly people and children, Muslims and Christians. The corrupt media is waging a war on labor protests, trying to mislead the public by describing them as sectarian demands. According to them, these demands disrupt stability and exacerbate the economic damage incurred after all sectors stopped working during the eighteen days of the revolution.,The truth is that the revolution did not disrupt stability, and its work did not damage the economy, but rather Mubarak and his heirs are the ones who did so over the past thirty years. We will not be fooled by their lies now. The workers’ participation in the last three days of the Egyptian revolution through protests and strikes was the final blow that forced Mubarak to step down. And now that he has stepped down, members of the National Democratic Party are hanging flyers with pictures of the revolution’s martyrs and trying to establish a political party under the name of the 25th of January. They think we have forgotten that they were behind killing hundreds and wounding thousands of our sons in the first days of the revolution, with the help of the police. They think they can make us reconcile with the police for free. Members of the National Democratic Party are trying to create skepticism and hesitation among the people about the importance of such protests, and to convince them not to participate in these “disruptive” acts. All of this is in the interests of the regime’s remnants, who dream of returning their positions they occupied before the 25th of January.,We have to stand against the counter-revolution by establishing committees to defend the revolution, educate the people, and mobilize them to insist on their demands and organize their lines. We have to uncover the lies of those traitors who only want to continue robbing Egypt, its people, and its revolution.,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153358im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID20,

This postponement should extend until after the trials of the leaders of corruption and of those who committed crimes of murder and torture and firing on the people, and until after the recovery of stolen state money and the companies and factories of the public sector that were unjustifiably or unlawfully given to the Egyptian and foreign private sector. This postponement must last until the election of a Constituent Assembly to lay out a new constitution for a parliamentary republic and a civil—not military or theocratic—state at least one year after the removal of all restrictions on democratic freedoms.,March 10, 2011.

Egyptian Media…Symbol of Hypocrisy,2011-03-25,2011,"[From Gurnal, Volume 1, page 12],Even though the Egyptian media has always been a waning media, it had a small amount of credibility, especially the national newspapers. After the events of January 25th, however, it lost what credibility it had. What was shown on television, the radio, and the national papers from the period of January 25th to February 11th was a deception to the people, and a distortion of the popular revolution. This position was expected, to a certain extent, since all of the editors of the national papers are from the NDP, just as the state security apparatus controls the totality of Egyptian media. As for those working for this institution, I personally did not expect them to forget their Egyptianness, and more important than that, their humanity. When the security forces were suppressing the protesters violently, they were claiming that the people attacked the security forces and the security forces were in a position of self-defense. During the attack of the thugs, the Egyptian media claimed that these thugs were pro-Mubarak protesters and that they were peaceful. After that they fired off various rumors about the revolutionaries, for example the exaggerated [claims] about our being led by foreign agents. In this way they hurled the rumor of “infiltrators” at us. After Mubarak stepped down from his post as President of the Republic, the Egyptian media change its tone completely, and started to recognize the revolution and its dazzling success. This is yet another of the regime’s games. All that the Egyptian media focused on after February 11th is the end of the revolution and the beginning of the building Egypt. The revolution, however, has not yet ended, for there are still demands that have not been met. The NDP has not yet been dissolved, and the state security apparatus has not yet fallen. Just like the big corrupt elements of the regime, like Zakariyya ‘Azmi, Sufut al-Sharif, and Fathi Surur, have not been touched. We must complete the revolution until it succeeds completely, for the fall of Mubarak and some of his aides does not mean the fall of the regime. The regime is still present and we have to destroy it completely. Just as we have to expose all the Egyptian media officials to legal accountability for the distortion and deception.,,Ziyad Tarek Hassan,“ِA Few Infiltrators”,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165356im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalPage122.png,imgID24,
A Message of Reproach,2011-03-25,2011,"[From Gurnal, Volume 1, Page 12],,We know now that this is not the time for healing or revenge; however during the days of the revolution, a question has been reverberating in my mind and I have yet to find an answer.,The police who represent a large and lively sector of society are supposed to have suffered from the injustice, corruption, and sadism of the regime, except that they did not participate in the protests until the very end, riding the new wave. They were, however—during days such as January 28th—oppressing the people and suppressing their dreams. With every bullet that they fired, they were killing their own personal dream and destroying the future of their children, too. Even if Habib al-‘Adili ordered them to do this, they still participated this crime by suppressing their patriotic feelings and their personal freedoms as well as by silencing their voices in the demand for freedom and closing their eyes from seeing the truth.,There were also, as usual, some public figures that chose the path of hypocrisy claiming that the youth movement and its opinion were a few infiltrators and that the deposed president, Hosni Mubarak, was like a father of Egyptians. To this, we respond by saying that a father defends the rights of his children and does not relinquish them. The blood of his children, the youth, ought to be precious to him; he should not let it spill like the blood of the martyr, Khalid Sa’id; the martyr, Marwa Al-Shibrawy; the martyr Sayyid Bilal; and the martyrs of the 1/25/2011 Revolution. These souls will chase him in his life and death. They will wake him from his sleep and torture him in his grave. These are pure innocent souls that were unjustly taken by—unfortunately—an Egyptian hand. When it became clear that the revolution was real, these blind figures had the audacity to break out into applause for the revolution.,As I said, this is not the time for revenge and personal reckoning. These figures, however, as well as some of the police will be kept awake by their consciences once it becomes clear to them that that revolution restored to them their stolen rights. This will not happen until everyone forgets his personal accounts and works for the sake of Egypt and heads towards construction and not towards destruction as Erdogan did in Turkey and Mahathir Mohamed in Malaysia and Japan after World War II. It’s certain that the day will come when the political reforms of the revolution are reflected in the economic and social conditions of the citizens—we wait in anticipation.,‘Isra’ Mahmud, 15 years [old],",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130170726im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalPage124.png,imgID25,
"Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1 (4 Pages)",2011-03-25,2011,"Page 1,Logo: “The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution”,A progressive publication issued by the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,Speaking of the counter-revolution is now no longer an exaggeration or undermining of the Egyptian people’s unprecedented achievement with this great revolution which has taken the whole world by surprise. Counter-revolutions inevitably follow popular revolutions seeking justice, freedom and equality just as they calm down to catch their breath.,The popular Egyptian revolution has achieved its first goal of toppling the tyrant who controlled power for thirty years. But this is only the top of the pyramid, and the task of destroying the large base that he was leaning on remains. Our revolution now is against the heirs and successors of Mubarak everywhere, those who want to reverse things to where they were prior to the 25th of January. Their plans are becoming very obvious: Ahmad Shafiq (who was appointed by Mubarak) is still heading the government. This is the man who mocked the revolution by saying that he was ready to distribute candy to Tahrir protesters because for them it was just a fun outing. How could we believe that Shafiq and his appointed ministers would honor the legitimate demands of the Egyptian people?? This is the man who idly watched the massacre of Bloody Wednesday in Tahrir Square, then announced that he did not know about it!! How can we trust those who swore an oath of loyalty to Mubarak??,Until now, their corrupt and despicable media has attempted to describe the revolution as a “youth revolution,” as if it were not a revolution of the whole population with all of its groups: men and women, elderly people and children, Muslims and Christians. The corrupt media is waging a war on labor protests, trying to mislead the public by describing them as sectarian demands. According to them, these demands disrupt stability and exacerbate the economic damage incurred after all sectors stopped working during the eighteen days of the revolution.,The truth is that the revolution did not disrupt stability, and its work did not damage the economy, but rather Mubarak and his heirs are the ones who did so over the past thirty years. We will not be fooled by their lies now. The workers’ participation in the last three days of the Egyptian revolution through protests and strikes was the final blow that forced Mubarak to step down. And now that he has stepped down, members of the National Democratic Party are hanging flyers with pictures of the revolution’s martyrs and trying to establish a political party under the name of the 25th of January. They think we have forgotten that they were behind killing hundreds and wounding thousands of our sons in the first days of the revolution, with the help of the police. They think they can make us reconcile with the police for free. Members of the National Democratic Party are trying to create skepticism and hesitation among the people about the importance of such protests, and to convince them not to participate in these “disruptive” acts. All of this is in the interests of the regime’s remnants, who dream of returning their positions they occupied before the 25th of January.,We have to stand against the counter-revolution by establishing committees to defend the revolution, educate the people, and mobilize them to insist on their demands and organize their lines. We have to uncover the lies of those traitors who only want to continue robbing Egypt, its people, and its revolution.,The Police: Between Accountability and Tolerance,,Thirty years of serious violations of Egyptians’ rights committed by the police across the length and breadth of the entire country… For thirty years, the police force has been sheltered by the notorious Emergency Law so that it could spread panic and fear throughout all of Egypt. Thousands of Egyptians were killed by torture in police slaughterhouses and State Security Headquarters, while tens of thousands of Egyptians survived torture, and continue to ruminate over wounds to spirit and body year after year. They saw their executioners, morning and night, strutting about freely in the knowledge they would not be punished, while their victims felt the sharp sting of injustice due to a legal system that separated them from their executioners.,,This is the savage State Security force. Its influence and the scope of its action spill into every aspect of life. It has final say on appointments within universities and scientific research centers. It has the power to prevent or allow academic research. It decides what parties and social civil institutions can and cannot be founded. It gives the green light for appointments to state newspapers, media outlets, and so on. On the other hand, it is the apparatus that arrests those in the political opposition or those who may be linked to the opposition. It tortures at will and illegally detains without notifying families of their children’s places of detention, forbidding them from contacting lawyers. Should they be freed from the State Security Headquarters, these detainees are moved to prison. Successive release orders are of no use, since before the detainee even sees sunlight, a second detention order will have been published, to the point that some detainees have gotten more than thirty rulings for release that have not been carried out.,,In the depths of the cells, in total isolation from the outside world, the systematic torture is carried out with impunity as attorneys do not have the right to search the places of detention. Additionally, the victims of torture cannot tell who exactly it is that tortures them.,,As for the police departments, and the investigative bureaus in particular, their scandals are well-known. Every citizen on Egyptian soil has been a potential victim of torture, not only those suspected of having committed a crime, no matter how serious or insignificant. Some torture on behalf of a third party, others torture in order to force people to admit to fabricated crimes, and still others torture because someone dared to raise a court case against those who tortured them. Yet others are tortured because they refuse to work as informants or because they refuse to pay the required extortion fees.,,And yet the police were not content with the crimes which are classified as crimes against humanity at the current number and breadth. Indeed, their abhorrent history culminates in facing off against peaceful demonstrators with live ammunition, running them over with armored tank wheels, and releasing thugs from prison to terrorize the people and confront the demonstrators.,,Police violence is not strange under this regime. However, it is strange and deplorable that we now hear voices calling to forgive the murderers and blood-letters, turn a new page, and unite together by returning to the slogan, “the police serve the people”! They have violated the sanctity of homes, murder after murder, torture after torture. Will modifying the behavior of the police and getting retribution from the perpetrators be enough to modify the slogan? Should we not, before turning a new page, open every closed torture file, whether it was done in police department detention centers, State Security, or prisons? Should not the citizen’s dignity be restored before we ask his tolerance?,,Should not the police force be purged of anyone found to have been involved in torture or mistreatment of citizens during the past thirty years and throughout the popular revolution?,,Should not the Egyptian law, which assisted in their avoiding punishment, be amended so that we are reassured that justice will stand against the perpetrators should they return to violate the rights of citizens? Should we not be reassured that the judicial authority, investigative bodies, and Forensic Medicine Authority are truly independent from the executive power?,,If you are serious about change, put them on trial. Amend the law. See that justice is brought to the victims. Now it is possible for us to band together, seeking how to create a new generation of civilian police that respects the nation and its citizens.,,Page 2,,Overthrowing the Arabian Giant: the Arab Peoples Revolt against Tyrants,The Tunisian people revolted and overthrew the dictator Ben ‘Ali, then the Egyptian people revolted and overthrew Mubarak. The revolutions of the Arab peoples are continuing in order to get rid of the corrupt regimes that govern them. Hence, the Libyan people’s revolution exploded against the tyrant Qaddafi, who used the most heinous and obscene methods to suppress their revolution.,The day in which the word of the Arab peoples—from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf—joins together has come. This time it is not in speeches, songs, nor with the handshakes of parade marshals. Instead, it is with the revolution. Its sun has risen to disperse the darkness and the cold of the past decades.,The revolution was not born in a single moment. Rather, social movements spread across Arab countries during the past years among the white- and blue-collar ranks and the racial and religious minorities who suffered persecution. These movements rose up in all the Arab countries, even though the details differed along with the forms of protest. We even witnessed them revolt in the Gulf countries, where we did not expect popular movements. They moved without being divided up by tribal, sectarian, and racial differences, which their regimes worked to fuel in order to protect their power.,The revolutions did not move about among the Arab peoples because of Al-Jazeera’s instigation —although we respect its position—or because of Facebook, as government media claimed. The Arab peoples revolted against regimes that exercised the most severe forms of exploitation against their peoples. They exploited the natural wealth of the country for the benefit of international corporations while granting immunity to those who benefitted from this. The regimes forbid the rights of expression and of forming parties and unions. The regimes groveled at the feet of the colonizers and stood before them like mice while facing their own peoples with masks of lions.,The knights of the Arab street lifted up the banners of justice and freedom and unsheathed determined swords. At the same time, the Arab rulers insisted on being stubborn and insolent as some of them strove to circumvent and attempted to deceive their people. However, they all followed the path of “the deposed Ben ‘Ali and Mubarak”. As for the Arab peoples, they fired a “heavy blow of clarity”, and they will not deceive them as the tongues accustomed to lying return. Rifles held in trembling hands will not scare them—nor the American support which reared our rulers in “its den”.,Arab regimes supported each other and gained power from colonial regimes. This is a signal to the revolutionary peoples to connect their struggles and unify their lines without looking to race, religion, color, or language. They will not be unified with the agreements and conglomerates of the regimes, but rather with the repressed peoples and the unity of their struggle.,Details of the Revolution from Tahrir Square,Eighteen days—the time of the sit-in in Tahrir Square—changed the face of history. There were not many optimists who expected the Egyptian people to be able to undertake their revolution with this amount of preparation, resistance, and awareness. I was honored to live this experience day after day and to witness the course of these days. The details were even more surprising. I am assuming that everyone followed the general events over the television screen and newspaper pages day after day. However, what I will try to get across to you are the details which led to this wonderful epic.,The square was the focal point of those who dreamt of freedom everywhere in Egypt. One morning, I saw a man and woman along with their three children. They seemed like they were from the farthest parts of Upper Egypt due to their accent and their white-cotton clothes. This was the day after the Battle of the Camels. The man was loudly screaming, “We’ve come from Suhaj so that we can die with you. Tell Mubarak that me and my family came of our own volition to die with the honorable ones. It’s like we’ve been dead anyway under his thirty years of rule!” The scene of them entering the square was absolutely fantastic.,The authorities cut off all the direct-broadcast feeds from Tahrir Square; everyone could feel the danger. This happened at the same time as the arrests of a large group of activists, including the storming of the Hisham Mubarak Center of Law along with the arrest of all the workers there. Thus the flow to the Square was even bigger the next morning. On that day, thugs prevented supplies from reaching the Square, whether it was medicine, food, blankets for keeping warm, or even bottles of water for drinking. I collected up some money from my colleagues to buy ful and ta‘miyya sandwiches to feed a large number of people. Looking at the meager amount we had gotten, we went to a restaurant and ordered 100 ful sandwiches and 100 ta‘miyya sandwiches. The owner of the restaurant asked us if the food was for the revolutionaries in the Square. When I told him yes, he started wishing us all success, and he insisted that he double the order to show his support for the sit-in. He added, “I’ll throw in the pickles for free.” He assured me that this contribution of his was no trouble at all since it was for those struggling to create a better future for him and his children.,Another scene which carries a lot of meaning was that of a Christian boy pouring water for a man with a large beard to do ablutions before the dawn prayer. At that time, I felt the depth of the feelings which had gathered up among all those who were in the Square—as if they were one big family, its individual members not paying any attention to the differences among them. It made them forget their ideological and religious affiliations and even made the differences between men and women vanish. Everyone forgot everything else, recognizing only that they were all Egyptians.,A Tale from the Curfew,The day that Mubarak stepped down from rule, the streets filled with rejoicing and revelers. Several days later, I, along with a group of my friends, decided to have a special party, and we all met up at one of our friend’s places. We all got there the usual ways, since we don’t have cars to get around in. The time flew by in an atmosphere of boisterous joy. We chanted nationalistic songs which flared our enthusiasm and our love for our dear Egypt until one of us called out: “Its twelve-thirty!” Worry began to cloud the purity of our joy and we all immediately got ready to go, asking about the ways to get back to our houses. We flew out into the street in a desperate attempt to find a taxi to take us to our houses. During our search, a number of soldiers from the Military Police, who were all over the area in which my friend lives, stopped us. They insisted on searching our bags and asked us the reason we were in the street at such an hour.,One of my friends kept telling them all about our party, but they didn’t listen to what he was saying and started to search us all. This increased the worry and nervousness which had by then moved on to our children, who don’t know the meaning the word “curfew”. My daughter asked me, “Didn’t Hosni Mubarak leave? Why don’t they want us to walk as we like in the street?” I didn’t answer her question. All I could think about was ending the unjustified siege which had surrounded us, despite the fact that our appearance didn’t make it look like we were breaking the law. I kept nervously looking for a way to quickly get to the house as joy had completely evaporated from my heart. Worry, accompanied by questions about what would happen in the coming days, had taken its place—questions about the necessity of this silly curfew which resembles a violation of people’s freedom to move when and where they like.,,Page 3,There is No Democracy without Social Justice,We all know that the most common forms of election fraud are vote-buying and exchanging incentives with government officials, piling them into governmental buses and bringing them to vote in the interest of the National Party’s candidates. Additionally, we all also know that the easiest way to bypass standing in a queue in front of one of the governmental departments in order to get something taken care of is to pay a “tip” (a bribe) to the responsible official. To avoid a traffic violation, which might be as much as one hundred pounds, you just have to pay ten pounds to the traffic cop. All of these images are the manifestations of tyranny, corruption, and a lack of democracy. It is not that we are psychologically ill or love corruption or those that make us go along with it. Rather, it is a natural result of the lack of justice in the distribution of society’s wealth among the citizens. The corrupt official who takes a few pounds from you to finish up your business more quickly sees his bosses charge exponentially in comparison to what he does. If his bribe is a few pounds, then his bosses’ bribes are in the thousands or sometimes millions. Therefore, it is not possible for you to ask him to be honorable when he cannot provide for his family. It is the same with the person who sells his vote in the elections to the highest bidder and humiliates himself in order to provide another meal for his family. If there were enough for him and his needs were met, then he would not be forced to give up faith in himself. This explains why democracy cannot be realized without social justice. Disbanding the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council, overturning the State of Emergency, and holding new elections will be futile as long as there are only a handful of people who own the wealth and the power, enjoying the blessing of life while there are millions of hungry mouths that do not have their daily bread and suffer a deprivation that those who have money would not be able to bear for even a day.,We must fight for social justice, a minimum wage proportional to prices, the right to a good education for all citizens without discrimination, the right to assume public office for all youths, the right to housing for all citizens, and free treatment for all who suffer from illness. If these demands are not met, nothing will change. Instead, there will only be superficial reforms from which the normal citizen, he who holds the right to every inch of this country, will not benefit.,,The Workers Want to Topple the Power of the Rich,“The power of the rich is a solid, secure base. Replacing any of its people, or overthrowing some of its figureheads, or even the parties themselves, does not affect the strength of this power or cause it to disappear. It is not even disturbed by such changes, and can reconfigure its political system, which only defends the interests of the rich. It can even rebuild and reorganize the security apparatus to suppress any attempts to overthrow it.”,Achieving the completion of the revolution—“the people want to overthrow the regime”—requires not only toppling the head of the regime and some of its figureheads, along with dissolving its representative institutions—“the People’s Assembly, the Shura Council”—and snatching up some democratic demands. It also requires stripping the police, “the tool of the oppressive regime,” of their political functions. This happens when all the apparatuses and departments that oppressed the masses for decades are dissolved, and those who took part in this oppression in any way, especially the “State Security and Central Security Forces,” are tried. It also requires the repeal of all financial and political privileges for senior civil servants, army generals, and the police. Additionally, an election should be held, and all officials in the state and its institutions removed. The regime’s figureheads, along with their followers and those that benefited from the regime, should be stripped of “their riches” and tried by the masses for their corruption.,It was the workers who struggled for decades against this regime’s corruption, tyranny, and injustice. It is they who have risen up and expanded their protests since 2006, exposing the violations committed by the ruling power, capitalism, and their intertwined interests. In turn, because the Egyptian working class joined the revolution with the weapon of the strike after having entered it through use of the protest at its beginning, they empowered the revolution and pushed it to take great strides forward, creating a magnificent, revolutionary situation in which it became impossible for Mubarak to stay in the seat of power. His decision to step down came quickly after. Following the fall of the regime’s head, the workers’ strikes and sit-ins began escalating and growing in order to establish their particular social “class” demands after having withdrawn from the square’s demands, in addition to the programs, plans, and slogans of the political powers. The official media, “Mubarak’s media,” some of the political powers, and military statements have come out against the workers to warn them of the danger of strikes with respect to “the national economy.” They are demanding that workers refrain from exercising the right to strike, a right which they attained through physical sacrifice during the many years of Mubarak’s rule.,A revolution that takes away the right of the workers to strike is not a revolution. As concerns the powers who are demanding that workers refrain from using this weapon, they are, in reality, servants of stability and the continuation of the old regime, and they strike the prospect of revolution’s continuation at its heart.,The working class is able to overthrow the regime by way of striking at the power of the rich that Mubarak and his businessmen created in every area of the country. It is able to destroy the monopoly and cut off the heads of corruption.,Is it not within workers’ rights to purify their elected and service institutions of the criminals who follow Mubarak? Is it not their right to demand the realization of social justice, a “slogan of the revolution,” which Egypt has not had for decades now?,We must learn from the experience of the workers in Ghazal al-Mahalla, who overthrew the Commissioner of that corrupt company and chose a new one from among themselves to administer it; we must do the same everywhere. If we really want the fall of the regime, let us replace all the figureheads with someone else.,Long live the workers’ struggle, the beating heart of the revolution,,My Son is a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution,These many millions who gathered several times in Tahrir Square until the fall of the tyrant Mubarak are rooted in the popular neighborhoods and the other governorates outside Cairo. Many of them are members of professional and workers’ unions, workers in factories and companies, officials in departments and agencies, and students in Egypt’s universities. They are the only ones who can guarantee that the revolution’s demands will be met. Without them, Mubarak would not have left, and without them, we will not achieve what remains for the revolution to do. The regime is still standing, though some of its figureheads have been removed and brought to trial—Habib al-’Adili, Ahmad ‘Izz, Mubarak, and others from among the corrupt are out there in every neighborhood, every governorate, at the head of every governmental service, and in the administration of every single state institution. They are the guardians of corruption whom we must remove from their positions in order to purify Egypt. We have to pursue the police officers who took part in the torture of citizens in the police departments that protect the neighborhoods and regions in which we live. We must knock on neighbors’ doors and collect the names of unemployed youths so that we can create unions for the unemployed, demanding the provision of work opportunities or the disbursement of unemployment allowances for every youth without a job. We must prepare to run our youths as candidates in the elections for the Local Councils and not leave them to the National Party, which destroyed the country during the years of the deposed President Mubarak’s rule and made these Councils a den of corruption and the corrupt.,Our revolution is not yet finished. The road before us—toward realizing the aspirations of our people for a free and dignified life in every meaning of these word—is a long one. We will not leave the streets again. We will stay vigilant in confronting all types of injustice and tyranny. We will not let them return again. This country is ours; the government and the regime are made up of officials whose salaries we pay from our own, that they might organize the work of state institutions, not oppress and humiliate us. The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are a starting point for creating permanent popular supervision over the work of the government, to counter its deviations and guarantee that it takes on the responsibility of serving the citizenry, not robbing from and marginalizing them.,,Page 4 [Page 2 is mistakenly written in the original],If, one day, the people want to live…,Many people were throwing words around and saying that the Egyptian people are “a cowardly people… a people that gets nothing but whip lashes, a servile people, unable to revolt.” One of the opposition writers said, “Every day, sewer pipes explode. As for the Egyptian people, well they don’t and they won’t…” Once, on the closing day of the National Party Conference, one of the newspapers said right on its front page, in the top headline, “The Conference is Done, the People are Done For.”,None of them noticed that the Egyptian people, like all other peoples, revolt when the reasons for revolution are abundant, nor that there is not one people in the world characterized by cowardice and submission. Revolution is a group action and a collective will. The Egyptian masses swept away the mighty apparatus of oppression in its entirety —the State Security Investigation Service, the Central Security Forces, the Special Military Forces, the National Party’s thugs—during the days of the Tahrir sit-in and protests in the provinces. When millions marched on the ‘Uruba and Ras al-Tin Palaces and on the radio and television buildings in Cairo and Alexandria, it was shown that Mubarak and his entourage were actually paper tigers, a weak cardboard carton. There were millions from the Egyptian masses talking about politics prior to January 25th,2011. These discussions went on inside houses, cafes, buses, and on terraces. The people were speaking more profoundly than the politicians were. However, the masses were going no further than talking. Their conversations served as a beginning. There were strikes and demonstrations of workers and employees since 2006, until January 25th plowed up the earth and brought fourth economic gains as well as the right to effectively strike, to sit-in, and to protest. There were some sectors from among the public moving to establish independent unions. All of these movements were steps leading to breaking the barrier of fear put forward by the arsenal of repression.,At the same time, the spark of January 25th—which the youth movement had started within the masses of the Egyptian people—began. The masses found before themselves particular, substantive, and well-suited conditions for revolutionary action. Millions responded to the intifada and changed it into a revolution. Prior to Mubarak’s second speech, on Wednesday, February 9th, workers had brought their strikes and sit-ins to Tahrir Square, which made the balance of power tip towards the decisive moment. On February 11th, when millions had gone out into the all the streets of Egypt, it was possible for the Egyptian people to depose the dictator, Mubarak.,There are still many steps in front of the Egyptian people along the way towards completing its revolution. The revolution’s slogans remain: “Freedom, Social Justice, and the Civil State.” They are in need of an organized mass movement in order to bring them to fruition—a popular movement which destroys the corners and foundations of the regime, paving the way to rebuilding on the bases of justice, freedom, and equality.,If, one day, the people want to live, then they must complete the revolution.,Our Demands,[Logo: The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution],To contact us and give your suggestions:,E-mail: [redacted],Phone #: [redacted],","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164016im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thawriya1.png,imgID26,

Interview with Hisham Al-Bastiusi,2011-03-21,2011,"[Gurnal, Vol. 1, Page 3],Has the regime fallen?,Of course the regime hasn’t fallen yet. President Mubarak, rather than managing the state from the presidential palace, has begun to direct it from Sharm el-Sheikh. A few of the symbols of the regime have been sacrificed to try and absorb the anger in the streets and allow the regime to remain. And the crippling [word play on ""amendment""] of the constitution, I mean, the regime is still in place even though its legitimacy has ended since the people revolted. And now we have to follow the legitimacy of the revolution, repeal the constitution completely, and put a new constitution in place. This isn’t as hard as everyone thinks, for we have more than one constitution that is in fact better than the one we desire, and voting on the constitution will not take months, as is alleged.,Changing the constitution will be considered a true completion of the revolution, because with the end of Constitution 74, this era will end, and with it all of the administrative corruption, and we will begin a new era established on a strong constitution and principles of fairness that satisfy the current demands on the Egyptian street. Therefore, those in power must recognize the legitimacy of the revolution and the nullification of the constitution. The articles that the constituent council is altering will form a temporary constitution until the election of Parliament. But if the amended Constitution 74 remains in place throughout the entire transitional period, it is possible that the people’s demands could be implemented inequitably.,,Who will supervise the next Parliamentary elections?,To ensure the greatest standard of integrity, the judiciary stipulated ensuring its actual independence before it would supervise elections. There is no reason that international monitoring should not take place to further ensure integrity throughout the upcoming elections.,,What are the main demands directed at those in power?,• The declaration that the amended constitution is a temporary constitution until such time as a Parliament is in place, when the people will then vote on a new constitution in order to protect their rights.• The punishment of all those who are corrupt and responsible for the crimes that were committed is the right of the protestors.• The release of all political prisoners.• The specification of the role of state security as the combatting of terrorism (with a clarification of what terrorism is, and so as not to lead to the deterioration of political life).• Dissolving Shafiq’s government and designating a temporary government whose members are known for their independence.,,In your opinion, what is the army’s position regarding popular demands?,In my opinion, from within, the army wants to fulfill popular demands, but some of those who have influence from within have a vested interest in the survival of the previous regime, which is slowing the implementation of these demands.,And because of this, the army must be pressured via sit-ins and a very clear demonstration of these basic demands until they are implemented quickly. No force, internal or external, can stand in the way of the revolution, not even the army or the United States itself. This became abundantly clear when the Egyptian streets proved that they are united and forced the United States to support them in spite of the fact that the Mubarak regime was in the best interest of this country allied to Israel.,,What means of pressure exist in order to realize these demands?,Contrary to what many think, weekly sit-ins are an effective means through which to pressure the attorney general and the supreme council of the armed forces to hasten the implementation of these demands. I remind everyone that differences around upcoming constitutional changes or presidential choices or the state system are premature because the regime still has not fallen and we must unite to face this regime first, and then begin looking toward the future.,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164630im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalpages1-421.png,imgID29,

The People Want the Fall of the Constitution,2011-03-21,2011,",,,[From Gurnal, Volume 1, Page 4],Cairo: Despite the fact that the committee which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces tasked with amending the current constitution has almost finished its work, it still faces widespread criticism, both on the political level and regarding rights themselves.,Many interested specialists in the legal field and constitutional matters have criticized the idea of amendments. These condemnations are directed at a number of issues. Among these criticisms are the sufficiency of modifying 5 articles, repealing only one, and not creating a new constitution, especially since the revolution overthrew the ruling regime and the existing constitution. Also, experts with ideological political leanings have joined the committee, and there are no women on it. Additionally, the current formation does not represent the political diversity of the country, and lawmakers from the old regime are even present on the committee itself. In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the committee is made up of seven experts, headed by the consultant Tariq al-Bashari, the First Deputy to the former Chair of the Council of State. Also, there are Dr. ‘Atif al-Banna, Professor of Constitutional Law at Cairo University, Hatim Bigatu, Chief of Commissioners at the Constitutional Court and aide to the former Minister of Justice, Hassanayn ‘Abd al-‘Al, aide on legal matters to the Speaker of the People’s Assembly , the consultant Muhammad al-Shanawi, former Chief of the Court, Subhi Salih, former representative from the Muslim Brotherhood in the People’s Assembly, and Hussein Badarawi, aide to the Minister of Justice for Legislative Administration.,Following what is happening now in the constitution drafting committee from the sidelines, it is difficult for us to see through the haze and lack of clarity. [This is the case] because the committee itself is made up of members of the previous regime and their aides and has no female perspective on the issue of the constitution or rights. There are also no independent constitutional scholars from this society that do not belong to any political or non-political current, for example: Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu al-Magd, the esteemed lawyer Isam al-Islambuli, Dr. Yahya al-Gamal, Dr. Muhammad Badran, and the consultant Tahani al-Gabali. It seems like the committee’s formation resembles the political spread of the representatives from the old regime with symbolic representation from the Muslim Brotherhood while other important national movements remain absent.,When discussing the creation of a new constitution, its formulation must agree with the current situation. Social necessity in relation to technological developments such as the emergence of Facebook and modern communications by mobile phone and e-mail, etc., demands this agreement. All of these things were not found in old constitutions, resulting in the underdevelopment from which many countries, among them Egypt, suffered. Now communication through technological means has become a fait accompli. It has no substitute; it is a human right which cannot be ignored. This is in addition to creative rights, which are the harbinger of the rise of peoples and spread of their cultures. Has the committee taken this problem into account or do the rights of communication, intellectual property, and creative rights remain outside of human necessity?,The history of revolution assures us of an important fact: revolution is the knowledge of change (not of replacement or rebuilding). The change for which we are calling is a total transformation of institutions and political structures within the country in order to establish a new order conforming with the spirit of the revolution. By changing or amending some of the articles in the constitution while preserving other parts of the text, one actually maintains the goals of the former regime which contradict the goals of the revolution. This creates a barrier in fulfilling the ambitions and aspirations of the general public.,As for the committee not having any women on it, it is completely unacceptable for half of society. It casts doubt on the future of democratic change in Egypt after the revolution and brings up questions regarding future participation, whereas the revolution aimed for freedom for all of society and not just limited sections. That does not mean to say that skepticism as regards the efficiency and integrity of the committee is a problem since it is headed by Tariq al-Bashari. This man’s history as far as professionalism, morality, and thoughtful contribution make him acceptable for everyone.,As for the amendments which will be made to the constitution, they are the same amendments upon which President Mubarak agreed before he left. They consist of five articles having to do with presidential term-limits, qualifications for candidacy, judicial monitoring of elections, the repeal of the article which permitted the president to declare a state of emergency, and referring citizens to military courts. The amendments are of little value and will not possibly lead to a democratic system, especially since the 25th of January Revolution overthrew and overrode the constitution. From there, it called for the proclamation of a new constitution. The amending of the constitution does not call for a voiding of the [the current constitution]. Amendments are what would happen under normal circumstances. However, following the success of the revolution, it is now necessary to completely repeal the constitution and create a new one in line with the demands of the next stage.The biggest flaw in the constitution is that it gives the president broad authority and allows him to exercise hegemony over all other authorities. It is within his rights to dissolve parliament and head up the Supreme Councils for Judges and the Armed Forces and the police and appoint their leaders. He also appoints one-third of the Shura Council and ten members of the People’s Assembly.,The constitution does not distinguish between executive and legislative powers and affects the independence of judges. Amending the constitution is not enough. It does not fulfill the aspirations of the Egyptian people who rose in a revolution praised by the world’s leaders who even called for teaching lessons about the revolution in their schools. Therefore, it is only right to work toward a new constitution founding a democratic state.,We call for the implementing of a parliamentary constitution because that is closer to the spirit of the Egyptian people. We would then have a president with limited powers, a president of an elected government, and a strong parliament which monitors itself—along with power to hold votes of no-confidence when it makes mistakes or fails in its commitments and duties to the people.,Khalid Tal‘atAppeals and Supreme Constitutional Attorney,",Constitution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165639im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalpages1-42.png,imgID31,
Has the Regime Fallen?,2011-03-21,2011,"[From Gurnal, Volume 1, Page 7],The people want the fall of the regime. Has the regime fallen???,Hosni Mubarak, his wife and children—the whole corrupt family whose departure we demanded—are still in Sharm al-Shaykh, in palaces protected by the Armed Forces, and Mubarak is eating, as the newspapers report, Swiss chocolate and caviar, and meeting with his Israeli masters. The tyrant chose Sharm al-Shaykh (his original, permanent place of residence since before the revolution) to make his own protection easier and be closer to the American Armed Forces present there, and he remained in that city for eighteen days, starting from the beginning of the revolution, to oversee the movement and transfer of his fortune, which he amassed from the livelihood of our people, to his friends the Gulf princes. After he moved to Sharm al-Shaykh, the leaders of our Armed Forces ignored our calls for ten more days before freezing his and his corrupt family’s assets (despite the British, French, and German governments’ announcement regarding the existence of vast amounts of money in his name in their countries, and their waiting for the sentence to be carried out in Egypt—God save her—requesting their being frozen). This allowed Mubarak to transfer and move the the majority of his assets. Why did the leaders of the Armed Forces and Ahmad Shafiq allow for this???,,Did he really resign???,Did he step down? Did he leave? (Never.) He announced he would stand down from his office and then remained in Egypt under the protection of the Army, living off of our money, smuggling and moving what he has smuggled to safer places. Who benefited from leaving seventy million dollars (four hundred fifty million Egyptian pounds) to be smuggled out and disappear throughout this period of time???,,Has the regime fallen???,Omar Sulayman is still the Vice President, and has been the leader of the regime’s Intelligence Agency for fifteen years now, in addition to being the first Israeli spy in Egypt (according to American and Israeli government reports released about him). All this time he wanted to be the ruler of Egypt, in order to keep it in Israel’s lap and keep the Egyptian people submissive. He has raided in the interests of a group of corrupt people and businessmen. Zakariyya ‘Azmi remained the manager of the tyrant’s office for the past fifteen years, and it is he who worked to cover up his and his master’s corruption and stealing of public money. What are these two crooks doing in the presidential palace if the regime has fallen???,,Has the regime fallen???,We still have Ahmad Shafiq, who received commissions for himself and his master from airplane deals with EgyptAir and the airport, and to whom the tyrant turned at the beginning of the revolution to protect him from it. We still have the Minister of the Interior, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Abu al-Ghit (Egypt’s disgrace for the past several years). That is to say we still have the prime minister and the three sovereign ministries as corrupt symbols, appointed by the tyrant and remaining for his protection.,,Has the regime fallen???,We still have the police, who killed hundreds of our martyrs as well as innocent women, children, and the elderly; who oppressed, arrested and tortured hundreds in prisons and detainment centers. Has a single one of them been brought to account??? We still have State Security, with its leaders and those it has imprisoned, who sniped at the honorable and tortured them, led the thugs and protected the corrupt for many long years; have they been disbanded? Has any one of them been tried?,,Has the regime fallen???,Where is Safwat Al-Sharif ‘Imad, the tyrant’s administrator, who started his life as a leader of the regime, passing from his own corruption of the Egyptian press on through his marginalization of the Shura Council, corrupting political life for the benefit of his thefts and the thefts of his master the tyrant; have we heard where he disappeared to? Has he been tried? Where is Fathi Surur, who tampered with the laws and rigged the elections in the interest of the tyrant for many long years and corrupted and doctored the constitution in the interest of bequeathing the country to the tyrant’s son (the corrupt Gamal)? Just as he sent out, and even paid off some of the thugs (according to those whom they arrested) in the infamous camel incident; have we heard where he is? Has he been tried for corruption, murder and forgery?,,Has the regime fallen???,We still have the editors-in-chief of the newspapers and television chairs, who exulted the tyrant, justified his actions, lied to the people for many long years, accused the Egyptian people of treason and brokerage throughout this noble revolution, and played a central role in the protection of the tyrant and his entourage, just as they spread corruption in the press organizations of our country. Robbery, comissions and debauchery. Usama Saraya (Al-Ahram newspaper)–Mumtaz al-Qatt (Al-Akhbar newspaper)–’Abdullah Kamal (Ruz al-Yusuf newspaper)–Muhammad ‘Ali Ibrahim (Al-Gumhuriyya newspaper)–Usama al-Shaykh and ‘Abd al-Latif al-Manawi (The Radio and Television Union)–have they been tried? Have they even been removed from their positions to prevent the continuation of corruption and lying and fabrication and what we all know about them?,,Has the regime fallen???,Thousands of prisoners from among honorable Egyptians who faced this regime have been thrown into prisons and detention centers, and there are still hundreds of youths—the heroes of the 25th of January Revolution—being tortured in detention centers, despite promises that they will be set free and that details of their location will be released. We still have Emergency Laws in place that violate our rights as human beings, permitting them to continue their subjugation, injustice, pompous demonstrations of strength, suspicion, imprisonment, and torture of those who challenge this regime.,,Then what did they do???,The tyrant resigned from his position in the ‘Uruba Palace and moved to his new position in the palaces of Sharm al-Shaykh. The chiefs (the three corrupt ministers and the criminal Ahmad ‘Izz) have been brought to trial to pay the price for their actions, and this is due to the regime’s anger at them for robberies outside the framework of commissions, considering them among the clique of his son, the corrupt Gamal. Even the killer Habib al-’Adili is being tried for money laundering and not the killing and torture of thousands; not for emptying the streets of security forces, not for setting criminals loose from prisons and not for blowing up the Church of the Two Priests (Kanisat al-Qiddissayn) in Alexandria (for he is implicated in it, as is his crony in the Ministry of the Interior and Central Security Forces, with their secret arrangement that prevented the circulation of news about it). Oh great people of Egypt, revolting from Aswan to Alexandria, and from Marsa Matruh to Sharm al-Shaykh (occupied by the tyrant and his cronies), and oh the blood of our righteous martyrs, and oh the pains of our injured and wounded, and oh the bellies of our people kept empty through the actions of the criminals and dogs of the regime. They will not deceive us again, for every drop of sweat from us and every resonant voice, every call of the muezzin and every church bell, every master of the pen and every honorable voice will continue to shout: the people want the regime to fall.,,Ahmed ‘Adil,Political Analyst and participant in Tahrir Square,Cairo, 24 February 2011,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162630im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalpages5-822.png,imgID32,
We See You…,2011-03-21,2011,"[From Gurnal, Volume 1, Page 6],The arrests are ongoing, and the army is continuing the work of the Interior Ministry. The army is not aligned with us, and the allegiance of its individuals is only to those who are among its ranks. It’s not over yet. Since the police withdrew, the military police have been strengthening their hold on the streets, and the incidents of torture have gone on without any interruption. Those arrested are treated like prisoners of war. News from the prison cells reports that women have been forbidden to use the bathrooms and forced to use the floors of their cells instead; cells in which there are twenty people. Prisoners are being confined in dark rooms, with only limited amounts of food and water, and are not allowed to sleep. The means of torture are similar to those of the Middle Ages. Fire and metal whips have become the preferred tools along with psychological torture. Prisoners are left blindfolded for days on end and may only be allowed to use the bathrooms rarely, if at all. They are fed nothing but crumbs and taunted daily with the hope of being set free, then comes the trauma of another day of terror. Not only are they left naked in pools of their own blood and deprived of medical attention except on very rare occasions, they are showered with water throughout the night to deprive them of sleep, or else forced to sleep outside in the rain. One of the victims says: “They forced me to hold onto live electrical wires with my hands. And they threatened that if I refused, they would put the wires on my genitals and tongue.” New prisoners receive a welcome called “the wedding procession,” meaning they enter blindfolded and are beaten with electric batons until they faint while they are accompanied to their cells. Another of the army’s “rituals” is the “meat grinder,” in which soldiers strip off prisoners’ clothes and force them to lie on their stomachs for hours while subjecting them to beating, burning, and electric shock. They are also called women’s names and threatened with rape on a daily basis. Additionally, cases have occurred in which a prisoner who died under torture is left chained to another prisoner who watches the corpse as it decomposes. Most of these horrible cases have happened at the army camps in Nasr City. It is sad that the protesters, as these crimes were happening, were all chanting together: “The army and the people are one hand.” How wise were those who succeeded, with a little skepticism and awareness, in preventing the army from entering Tahrir Square. How sad, for the army owes its allegiance to these criminals who are attempting to hang onto what little power they have left. Only God knows what will happen after that, but this is our letter to those “soldiers:” we know what you are doing. We see you. We know who you are and where you are. And you will be tried for these crimes against humanity. And know that the families of those you have killed and those you have maimed will not tire of pursuing you until this black page is turned.

No to the Constitutional Amendments… Yes to a New Constitution,2011-03-21,2011,"The Popular Alliance Party announces along with its founding its rejection of the amendments to the constitution which the January 25 Revolution did away with. The party considers these amendments to be tantamount to a call to deviate from the path of the revolution and to turn it into an operation which will reform the old regime. However, the definitive cause which the revolution has embraced is the overthrow of the regime along with all of its symbols, arms, and institutions, as well as its constitution and its dictatorial edifice whereas the amendments concentrate on the conditions regarding the election of the president.,As for the matter of the presidency itself, the amendments have ignored the total powers given to the president which make him a Pharaoh who sits above other sources of power (he can form the government and dissolve parliament and appoint one third of the members of the upper house of parliament (The Shura Council) and head the Supreme Council of Judges) … everything in one person! The main cause which the revolution has taken up is not the manner of electing the dictator but rather preventing the appearance of a new dictator and a return of dignity to the people, they being the ultimate source of authority.,Likewise, the amendments have jumped over the discussion revolving around a presidential republic and a parliamentary republic, and so too have they jumped over the priorities which match up with a process of change which responds to the demands of the revolution.,It is incomprehensible how rushed the process of drawing up these amendments has been, presenting them to the people to vote on in a referendum within mere weeks, and carrying out three sets of elections (for the presidency and both houses of parliament) within a few months. Although the fact is that there are other ways to conform to the desire of the Military Council for returning to the barracks, such as forming a presidential council and issuing a constitutional statement to safeguard freedoms during the transitional period.,On the contrary, beginning to amend the constitution with the claim of calling for early elections is putting the cart before the horse. One of the reasons for the explosion of the revolution was obstructionism in politics, stagnation of official political life, and the control of the police, the security apparatus, and the administration over labor unions, political parties, and national organizations of all stripes as well as the incompatibility of the dictatorial police state with the facts of life under which organizations of change have developed, outside of this rotten enclosure.,The recognition of the legitimacy of the revolution merely means beginning firstly with the announcement of general freedoms and their protection and secondly the preparation of the soil for the young forces of the revolution and finally giving them the necessary amount of time to develop a level of organization which they were denied in the past. In contrast, early elections will lead to a return of the influence of the old powers which are maliciously fighting in order to return to their old positions to undermine the revolution. They represent the true threat to the stability which the Military Council calls for.,In the correct ordering of priorities and in order to respond to the demands and the goals of the revolution, Egypt is still in need of a declaration of general freedoms, a declaration which resembles the Declaration of the Rights of Man in the French Revolution or the Declaration of Independence in the American Revolution, a declaration to be a fruit of the Revolution and a promise of a new era:,A declaration to secure the right to organize and establish parties, organizations, labor unions, trade unions by merely noting the free will of the founders without waiting for a permit from the administration. A declaration to guarantee all manners of voluntary association the right to publish literature and which would free them from all guardianship and which would not subject them to any sort of censorship except the oversight of their members;,A declaration to bestow the right to publish newspapers and the right to assemble, demonstrate, strike, and hold sit-ins, a declaration to complete the dissolution of parliament and the local councils and end governance based on the emergency law;,A declaration to confirm a state based on the rule of law, with equality of all citizens before the law with no discrimination and to guarantee complete the civil rights for all Egyptians to take on official positions without distinction. A declaration to establish the true independence of the three branches of government along with the steps that would follow: the dissolution the investigative apparatus of State Security which played the role of the true ruler in political parties, labor unions, neighborhoods, administration of the government, universities and sites of production; the release of political prisoners and the transfer of prisons and other places of detention within police stations to the authority of the Ministry of Justice, and the transfer of authority over all judicial bodies to an independent Supreme Judicial Council, a special body with its own budget, and the dissolution of military courts and all manners of irregular justice;,A declaration to confirm the dedication of the state to the socio-economic rights of Egyptians at the front of which are the rights to food, education, housing, work, health care, and a just wage.,Tahrir Square has raised the banner, “The army and the people, one hand”, and its interpretation by the Military Council ought to be to slow the pace of constitutional amendments in order to issue a declaration of freedoms.,The Popular Alliance demands that the Military Council back down from its call for citizens to vote in a referendum on amendments to a constitution which has lost its legitimacy and calls for cooperation between all the forces of the revolution to block this step by means of a letter-writing campaign to the Military Council and by holding assemblies in neighborhoods and workplaces and all other manners of expression which can be agreed upon such as demonstrations, sit-ins, etc.,And in the case that the referendum is carried out, the Popular Alliance Party calls for citizens to vote no on the amendments as an indication of a refusal to revive a dead constitution currently being dressed up and as an indication of their insistence upon a new constitution to realize the hopes of the Revolution.,The Popular Alliance Party (newly founded),11 March 2011,","Constitution, March Referendum",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162638im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/NoToAmendmentsYestoANewConstitutionNEW.png,imgID35,

This is the world which unanimously supports respect for justice, freedom, rights, and equality but it did not and will not agree on a leading person, reformer or colonel. Rather, [that] he find in that person’s biography [i.e., in his 'real’ person, as opposed to just his name] what he likes and what he hates, what he supports and what he opposes.

Were not the camels [what] most drew our attention? … Why the mule, specifically?,To be honest the answer is not simple … but after some thinking … I found that the title, as it stands, is more precise…more cogent…the way it is. The camel (“gamal“) has outstanding patience, good pride and an ingrained Bedouin honor. And all of these are meanings that contradict—strongly—that which characterized their riders, as far as morals go, on the Day of Shame which was the complete opposite of that. the word “gamil“ (beautiful) has its origin in the noun “gamal“ (camel) and the word “’aniq“ (elegant) its roots are “naqa“ (female camel). Even „hanin“ (compassion) is the sound of the female camel which “ongs“ for its child … So was there among the thugs of regime something like “beauty,” “elegance,” or “compassion“?,The horse is the same …someone “yajud“ (is generous) with what he has … therefore he is “gawad“ (generous/a great horse). Noble morals are the morals of “chivalry“ … even the foal is beautiful … its hair is usually a “horse tail”,No sir … it is not the camel’s battle … and it is not the horse’s battle … it is the mule’s and no other but the mule’s battle. Not because it is the last possible choice … but – and its application here has deep-seated proof/evidence – because it greatly resembles the so-designated regime … My apologies about what I will write in the following lines and what attaches to the honor of the mules …,The mule, first of all, is a half-breed … Its existence is rooted in a mistake … against nature … a foolish filly … in a rare weak moment … allowed a young excited donkey to pollute its womb … and so the mule came to exist … or a silly stallion … blind in eyesight as well as in understanding … leaves the horses for this faulty creation, he becomes intimate, we hear neighing, and a nucleus [sperm] breaks of from the house … and there was the mule …This is what the regime was like … its existence is rooted in a mistake … against nature …,The mule is – secondly – stubborn … its head is like granite, it does not understand, listen, or respond. Often we find someone in the novels of Nagib Mahfuz who is stubborn like a mule …,This is what the regime was like … stubborn … does not understand, listen, or respond…,The mule is – thirdly – sterile… having neither future, nor offspring … being neither male nor female, neither virile nor castrated, neither sterile nor fertile, but rather a lonely creature without trouble, taste or identity … just a mule.,This is what the regime was like which released the mules to kill the heros of the liberation … a lonely creature, no other regime resembling it, not having any color, taste or identity.,And most important – and this is now our task– it has no future!,,Ahmad – Cairo,",Solidarity,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162655im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalpages5-811.png,imgID39,
The Justice Party: List of Demands,2011-03-20,2011,"In the Name of God, the Merciful the Compassionate:,The Justice Party is Under Construction ((Our program of justice to establish ownership)) for the Egyptian people of ((daily bread and self-determination)).,We are on our way to achieving it. We presented this document to the Field Marshal with a list of demands for achieving social justice—the basis of freedom and democracy— from which the revolution broke out on January 25th.,These are the demands that form the basis of the party’s program: choosing a president like Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, ministers like ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, and Yusif (peace be unto him in his possessions), ministers of defense like Khalid, Al-Qa‘qa‘, and Abu ‘Ubaida Al-Jarrah, and a consultative assembly like the apostles of Jesus (peace be unto him). Of course, we will not emulate them, but rather follow their examples.-Majdi Khazbak,The following is a speech regarding demands presented under number 72 at the Citizen’s Affairs Desk on 2/14/2011, to the Ministry of Defense in Cairo, Field Marshall and Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and leader of the current revolution Hussein Tantawi, leader of the members of the of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.,After the greeting…,From a citizen of the Land of Kinana, Egypt, to the councilmen in your capacity as leaders during the interim period of the Egyptian Revolution, we seek the following from you:,Firstly, a statement produced on all the properties owned by the former president and his relatives, as well as the former employees of the state apparatus, accrued through their corruption.,Secondly, to strike with an iron hand every corrupt individual who robbed the wealth, commercial, and land properties of the Egyptian people and sold them for the cheapest prices. To ensure this, we implore your councilmen to execute the following important steps:,A) To produce a statement that forces those who have been involved in bribery or brokerage commission, and gained from it, to provide a statement to those overseeing illicit losses with names of those who benefited from this for the duration of a month. This will determine the actual cost of the original buying value that the assets were purchased at according to the agreement made by the former entity of the corrupt state.,B) Gather all sales records for production—agricultural, commercial, or non-commercial—facilities owned by the state after the month time limit granted to the buyers. Record the actual cost of all suspicious sales undertaken by the former state.,C) Form a committee or group of committees made up of persons who can uphold the integrity of information to account for the market price at the time of all sales contracts and determine the differences to be paid to the Public Treasury as a result of the sale of these assets.If the beneficiary is not able to pay the value of the difference, then terminate his contract and return his purchasing power to him in relation to the portion of capital paid and the actual value at the time of purchase to the current market value. This value is to be assessed based on the price determined by competitive bidding in accordance with the tender law. Or, if the project is indivisible, offer that he undertakes the project as a partner with the state using the value of his paid capital, to be estimated at the current value.,Limit the work period of these committees to a maximum of six months from the date of the statement, in order to complete the task.Thirdly, activate the role of the public sector that shall complete the retrieval of suspicious sales operations and allow those renowned for their efficiency and integrity in the administration to take over these projects to assure suitable work opportunities. The state should seize control over the parts of the industrial and commercial sectors that the former regime lost, as well as their facilities. The most influential industries are iron, concrete, fertilizers, gas resources, and so forth, from the vibrant facilities which gave their lost prestige to the state during the former regime.,Fourth, select a sufficient parliament possessing efficiency and integrity made up of those who neither agreed with the former regime nor fell in line, and there are plenty of such loyal citizens in Egypt.,Fifth, invest all state resources to create sustainable national production, commercial, and agricultural factories of all kinds, and to build up state resources, both human and material. This is to let prosperity prevail across Egypt so that poor citizens feel the gains of the revolution with the provision of job opportunities, income increases, and the provision of essential human necessities according to their income levels.,","Politics, The Justice Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151950im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/justicepartyforthefoundationof.png,imgID40,
"March Forward, Invent",2011-03-20,2011,"[From Gurnal, Volume 1, page 8],,,Revolutions are always good at what they do. Your revolution/this revolution of ours is likely more so, with regards to how suddenly it happened, and how quickly people began revolting, to say nothing of its peacefulness, cleanliness, effectiveness, and victory. Many revolutions, however, are created by revolutionaries only to be inherited by scoundrels. So how can we preserve what we have gained in the face of this danger, among many others?,I am not optimistic and do not want to be. At the same time, however, I have begun fearing that looking backwards (and towards politics) will win out over what we are now facing, and that as a consequence we will miss great opportunities for speedy forward progress, efficiency, and developing the appropriate organization for the current moment. I fear that we will busy ourselves with holding the past accountable and taking revenge on its actors at the expense of participating in creating the future and its leaders (not merely electing them). I fear that our joy over what we have accomplished will engross us and we will continue to look upon it with all of the honor it deserves; but by focusing our attention on our boasting and happiness we neglect progress towards an even happier, more successful and more productive future, and probably also towards some necessary difficulties. I fear that we will be absorbed in politics as a spectacle. Our waiting is full of both hope and fear: each of us will be removed from the various fields in which he can work. What then?,What will these youths themselves do after the clamor quiets down and life returns to its normal (and probably required) routine? Will we be satisfied in the future by that which has yet to satisfy us? Will we be satisfied by waiting to see what changes politicians and those crafting the constitution will produce, however grand? Or must the change the character of our daily lives change in order to preserve the beauty, suddenness, and creativity we are enjoying now!!! What made me (us) happiest, moved me, and made me cry was a scene of a street being cleaned right after Mubarak’s resignation. Similarly, I just about burst with joy when I heard a request that on the following Friday (the 25th of February), everyone who plays an instrument or sings should go out and fill the streets with beauty, camaraderie, sorrow, and civility. What does all of this creativity have to do with suggestions for improvement and work!!?? This revolution itself was a product of the very creativity represented in this request, as well as in mutual communication, organization, and execution! Oh Lord! Grant success to the following Friday (25th of February) like you granted success to the previous Fridays as well as the days in between. Similarly, the experience of creating “Gurnal” also made me happy—taking it on as a project, its distinctive focus on collaborative work, and the beauty it has produced.,We are, however, in need of more projects like this. We are in need of infinite successful suggestions. We are in need of initiatives which do not wait for politicians but rather challenge them; even if they were the greatest politicians in our history. We are in equal need of collaborative and personal creativity. This is what will guarantee the preservation of the revolution’s vigor. Therefore, my invitation to you ends with precisely this: present us with more of your activities and your innovative ideas, be it music, newspapers, organizations, political parties, party invitations, poetry, painting, exhibitions on the street, a simple idea that we can all converge upon, even if only for a short time, or work and courage, or anything else I am not yet aware you are capable of creating. Let any of this be so that there can be life and culture, and so that we can create the future that we all deserve.,,-Muhammad al-Rakhawi,,",Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160735im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalpages5-811.png,imgID41,

"Dostour 2011, Vols. 1 and 2",2011-03-20,2011,",Number One and Two Together,www.dostour2011.com,(Article Title): We will write our constitution ourselves because we won’t get another.www.dostour2011.com,The goals of the revolution have not been realized yet. The revolution has not ended and whoever thinks it has is wrong. The goals of the revolution and its lasting, definitive success will not be complete until firm and precise rules have been established for a new regime that will guarantee the state functions like a computer operating system: in a sound and clearly-defined manner that does not allow for error or corruption, but leads to a peaceful and successful execution of the people’s will and what they decide for the new republic.,It is a significant point of pride that the British Prime Minister has announced he wants the Egyptian revolution to be taught in English schools. This announcement means that the 2011 Egyptian revolution has without a doubt moved forward on the wheel of history, surpassing all the previous models for revolution through its use of contemporary techniques and the latest ideas. It didn’t allow us to look back at European models for writing the new constitution, because if we had, we would have only been advancing backwards. We have reached a stage in history in which has God willed that Egypt should once again become a leading nation, defining a new global order of rule by the people the likes of which the world has never seen before, far surpassing what we call modern history and governing institutions. This is what we hope will be revealed over the course of the next few days as the new constitution structures a new regime.,The next stage in the political history of world civilizations, which is now being written by the Egyptian people as the natural progression of the 2011 revolution, is for the Egyptian people to be able to evaluate any state-building regime. This is what we call the constitution itself without anyone’s mandate, for the age of mandates has ended. This process will not be complete until any Egyptian citizen can have a role in suggesting either amendments to the constitution or new articles to be added as he sees fit.,It is the responsibility of any current or future appointing committee to first focus its attention only on those demands which are possible, lawful, just, positive, and in the people’s interest, then write them properly in the new constitution. And it is not the place of any constitutional committee to make legislative decisions on behalf of a well-informed population, nor should it limit the people’s capabilities in such a way that it reproduces the kind of masked dictatorship that would lead the nation backwards.,Let us share some examples of the suggestions for rewriting the constitution that have come from the people and not from university professors, legislators, or any particular committee. These suggestions have not been proposed before:,1. The Section on the Economy in the Constitution.Adding the following article: “Selling State Assets”No state assets can be sold without recourse to (what the people determine from the following choices):A. A parliamentary vote from the People’s AssemblyB. Seventy-five percent of companies’ workers, employees, and managers have the right to veto.C. Popular public referendum vote.,2. Salary Minimums“Salary minimums will be adjusted according to yearly inflation, so that we do not institute a new system where working class individuals find themselves poorer each year, as in the aftermath of the 1952 revolution.”,3. Economic Development“Companies will be obligated to put a portion of their yearly profits toward pensions for their workers, employees, and managers (to be limited as experts see fit and then stipulated in the constitution).”,,This is the best guarantee to speed up productivity, growth, and progress. Under these circumstances, once everyone sees that raises follow the market economy in a just and reasonable fashion, and are gained only through increased productivity, they will in turn focus on increasing production in kind and quantity, instead of idleness and strikes. This will bring us up to speed with modern, Western theories based on the conflict between socialism and capitalism in a new unitary system where the interests of all social classes and groups come together in a positive and just manner. We will then have established a new economic system that is above conflict between its groups, for in the end if common welfare does not enter in to the picture, then disunity arises.,4. General FreedomsAny member of the executive power (the police) who violates human rights or the rights of citizens should be subject to specific punishments laid out in the constitution. These punishments should not exclude dismissing the Minister of the Interior, so that he will work hard to assure the safety and personal security of every citizen in police custody.5. “The government should be required to publish the state budget in detail using print and electronic media for the people to read carefully.” The central accounting office should also be required to publish all of its decisions immediately, using the same means, in order to guarantee transparency among the people, preserve their rights, and combat corruption.,,(Page 2),,This is only a fraction of what the Egyptian people’s intellects can suggest in the course of deciding the capabilities of the new regime.The current constitution is, for the most part, corrupt. Each article that organizes state relations and the way in which they are effected ends with the expression “according to the law,” and in this way the former corrupt regime altered the substance of the law without recourse to the people. Consequently, the former regime modified the constitution according to its corrupt dictatorial whims, even though, according to legal and political philosophy, the law is only a tool for the protection of the constitution and a means of its implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to annul these additions altogether and define the constitution’s substance with the greatest of care.,The first priority now is the constitution; it must institute a new order for the country that propels it toward progress and regulates all state relations in the best manner possible; it must be decided upon by the people, for their will and right to shape their own new order and initiate a new republic with only a benign connection to the past should not be stolen from them. If these priorities are not met, then we will have fallen into the trap of a constitution the current suggested amendments to which do little more than circulate power. The old guard of the regime will be renewed by the likes of Safwat al-Sharif and others, who share power among themselves. We will have replaced Hosni Mubarak with others from his royal entourage who exchange power among themselves every two administrations.,So let us concentrate on what is most important: the constitution as a system that puts the entire coutry to work managing itself. We will drive out all those who were part of the old regime, who try to ride the revolution as though it were a horse, who try to exploit this opportunity to subvert the will of the people, and every corrupt person.,In light of all this, a group of Egyptian citizens have set up a website, using the most modern global technology, in order to achieve this goal and enable anyone who wishes to read the constitution section by section and article by article; then, if he wants, he may suggest amendments or additions.,Afterward, all of the suggestions will be automatically sent electronically in two directions. First, they will automatically be recorded in a blog for anyone from the committees or the people who visit the website to see. Second, all suggestions pertinent to revising the constitution or adding new articles to it will be made available on comments pages through the website, with a separate comment page for each article of the constitution. This will facilitate comprehension of the constitution’s articles and to increase the people’s enlightenment. For, as the saying goes, where the language of the intellect is concerned 1 + 1 = 3, not two. So what do you think? Would you like to meet hundreds of thousands or even millions of those who are interested in—and indeed insist upon—informed participation in setting the parameters of their new state, just as their informed participation and internet communication led to the first conscious, tech-savvy revolution in the history of mankind and all its civilizations?,The website’s features enable the people to share their opinions about these suggestions so that the people can settle on one suggestion for each of the articles to be revised. These features also enable the people themselves to forward a summary of their amendment suggestions to the committee formed to write its will and demands in sound constitutional language.,Whoever contends that the Egyptian people are ignorant and ill-prepared to make this historic leap and achieve this supreme goal of democracy is wrong. He is still living in the past, under the old, refuted regime, proposing that the people be subjected to dictatorship yet again. He is wrong because among the people of Egypt there are great intellectuals and scholars who have surpassed the entire world with their success, obtaining the highest medals and degrees in all walks of life organized by the constitution, such as economy, education, general freedoms, etc.,These modern technologies not only enable us to progress along the same path as the nations of the modern world in methods of government and setting the country’s course through traditional parliamentary representation (the People’s Assembly); they will also bring about a revolution in the intellects of all individuals who so desire it, and who in the course of a few days or months will reach levels of popular political, economic, and educational erudition, as well as rights, duties, and general freedoms, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Then and only then will we have brought to fruition the most complete, modern, and ideal revolution on all levels and in all directions.,And if someone contends that time is of the essence and that all of this will take months, and that we are in pressing need of a temporary constitution until the people can establish a finalized one, reason might permit the validity of his argument in only one case: if the amendments up for approval were to include an article that binds the next president of the republic to ratifying a complete revision of the constitution within a fixed and clearly stated time frame, and if he doesn’t he becomes an unconstitutional president, or if the constitution currently up for revision were accompanied by a state instrument permitting revision by referendum, and that this be incumbent on any future power. This is the will of the people.,Inset: Distinguished Members of the High Council, our message has not yet reached you.. our message is for a safe constitution. www.dostour2011.com,And if the violent death of Khalid Sa’id, may he rest in peace, led many individuals to feel, “We are all Khalid Sa’id,” then for the sake of the nation, freedom, and the new republican institution, then “We are all the constitutional committee.”,We must take into consideration our various political, economic, and religious orientations in order to establish a system we agree on as a people—a committed, precise, and healthy operating system of the state, i.e. a new constitution—and we will not disagree until we make our will a reality. Only then can we disagree in peace and brotherhood, with each of us expressing his political and economic views, voicing disagreements over this regime or this new constitution. This is the utmost degree of democracy that we are about to teach to the world, as the British prime minister and even the president of America itself have pointed out.,The Egyptian people are writing history now; we are all writing history together. Share in the writing of your country’s constitution. Refuse to surrender this basic right that is the source of every constitution and even of political philosophy itself, the basis of any constitution. Share in putting Egypt on the path to world leadership, leading civilizations as it taught them agriculture seven thousand years ago.,This Egyptian website, the first in the world to present the latest technological tools, is currently being recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the first website in the history of world civilizations able to completely surpass traditional representative democracy, just as the invention of the automobile brought the age of the carriage to an end, and world civilization subsequently developed in new ways that the age of the carriage had never seen, since people at that time depended on the limited capabilities of horsepower. But the Guiness Organization responded that recording the website in its encyclopedia won’t be possible until the Egyptian people reach a record number of people participating in the writing of the constitution. This is what will enable us to record the Egyptian people themselves as the first people in the world to make this historic achievement, never before realized in the same way: through igniting revolution itself.,This is what we name the age of “Post-Western Modern Democracy,” which we are currently founding together; it will surpass the regimes of the modern Western world, without looking back at the constitutional models or manners of expression that the westerners relied upon during the Enlightenment in the nineteenth century. That was their Renaissance more than a hundred years ago, and it came from their experiences alone, not ours.,Whoever looks back hampers and damages the unique experience of our revolution, built upon the latest technologies the world has seen and thereby serving as a door to the future, not the past. Some esteemed and honorable professors’ suggestion to use the 1954 Constitution as a model for the new one is a fine and poignant one, but it is not sufficient. That Constitution is closer to the age of the 1919 Revolution by about two thirds, and has more to do with the 1923 Constitution than the 2011 Revolution. The new Constitution must be developed according to the will of the current people, not imposed upon this developed people after sixty years of experiences, lessons, and modern technology have surpassed the old constitution by a long shot. The old constitution may remain a thing of the past that of which we remain proud, but it must be developed according to the suggestions of the younger generation.,The people must be granted the opportunity to develop the present administration by writing the constitutions and establishing their own fate.,Don’t let anyone steal your revolution. The people are the ones to write the constitution.,May God bless Egypt and the Egyptian people.,,,As we affirmed in the first volume—before the announcement of the suggested amendments to the old and corrupt constitution, which enabled an era of dictatorship and theft of the people’s money—the experience and intellect of the people are far beyond that of any official council. And as we will show, we have no choice but to overthrow all trusteeship in the amending of the constitution by enabling the people to make known their wishes and demands in these amendments.,,The suggested amendments from the council—appointed by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to amend the current corrupt constitution temporarily and headed by Dr. Tariq al-Bashari—are incomplete and inconsistent with the will of the people and the revolution; they prove once again that no constituent council or assembly, whatever legal expertise its members may have, can be an alternative to the right of the people to determine the articles of the constitution by way of modern techniques of communication. The role of any future constituent council or assembly should be limited to the study and framing of the possible, just, legitimate, positive, and popular suggestions of anyone who wishes to participate from among all the individuals of the population, without any trusteeship, for this is true democracy.,,Amendments and additions suggested by the people, necessary if the submitted temporary amendments are to represent the irreversible will of the people and the revolution:,,1. Confirmation that the suggested amendments to the pre-revolutionary constitution are temporary in clear constitutional language, instead of the linguistic trickery in the article the Special Council has proposed in this regard, which leaves it to the new president and Parliament, whose identity we do not yet know, to determine and establish of a new constitution from nothing:,,“The President of the Republic commits to issuing a new constitution for the country in a maximum of one year from the date of his inauguration. If he does not do so he will become an unconstitutional president, and his responsibilities will be assumed by a constituent assembly elected by the people without nomination restrictions, according to a schedule of implementation attached to this article.”,,2. Confirmation of the end of dictatorship through the limitation of the next President of the Republic’s powers before his election, so as to avoid any dispute or future attempt at tyranny; this is the essential goal of the revolution that the current temporary amendments to the constitution must include.,,3. The President of the Republic has no right to appoint any members to the two houses of Parliament, so that full democracy can be realized without the President exploiting his leverage.,,The constitutional amendments suggested up to this point do little more than exchange the supplanted dictator Hosni Mubarak with another dictator every eight years instead of every thirty years. But you will not trick the people this time because we’ve learned all the lessons of history; the people have become more conscious than those who legislate for them.,,4. Confirmation that the era of financial and administrative corruption has come to an end:,,“The President of the Republic commits, as do all who accept a job in the state, government, or in Parliamentary representation, to present a detailed affirmation of financial responsibility to the Central Auditing Agency, not only to the Internal Revenue Service, before taking on the responsibilities of his position, in order to facilitate this monitoring body’s task of uncovering any type of corruption.”,,5. The limitation of the age of presidential candidate: the current constitution deems it wise to limit the candidacy for the position of President of the Republic to those who are older than forty; the same logic should also require that the age of the candidate not exceed sixty-five.,,6. Confirmation—in a clear constitutional article—that the role of the corrupt media will be limited and that the age of media directed by the election of the President of the Republic (brainwashing) has come to an end:,,“All media—both public and independent, as a condition of their independence—including television, the press, and others, commit to presenting the same airtime and page space equally to every presidential candidate.”,,This article guarantees the end of media censorship and satisfies the revolution’s insistence on transforming [the media] into a true and just democratic device for increasing the people’s knowledge and awareness without affecting their basic constitutional right to complete knowledge and determination of their own wishes—based on this new constitutional right to complete knowledge.,,7. Confirmation of meaningful objectiveness as the basis of candidacy:,,“Every candidate in all state elections, including presidential, must present a platform after completing nomination procedures within one month at the maximum, and this as a necessary condition of his candidacy in the election. The constitution furthermore calls for a minimum period of three months from the date of nomination to give the people an opportunity to study and discuss the presented platform, just as it considers participation in a live debate between all candidates (where individuals take turns speaking) a necessary condition for those who wish to run for office. Finally, all independent and government media commit to the full transmission of these debates live on the air in order to ensure the objectivity, democracy and transparency of the electoral process and establish the constitutional right of the people to complete knowledge.”,,8. Confirmation that possession of a national identification number alone guarantees every citizen’s constitutional right to vote in all future elections, without requiring that citizens register this number at an election office or other point of registration. For it seems that there is a new political plan, unannounced, unconstitutional and corrupt—put in place by the old guard despite the council’s affirmation that a national identification number is all that citizens will need to vote in the upcoming election [i.e. the referendum vote on March 19th]—according to which whoever does not record his national identification number with the electoral department before March 7th—just a few days from now—will not be able to vote with an ID number alone. Besides the fact that this will prevent most people from voting on the constitutional amendments, it is a corrupt decree that will enable the hired guns of the National Democratic Party to implement a false majority that does not represent the will of the revolution.,,On this matter, the people will not accept any objections from any side. Very simply, all of the information linked with each national identification number is recorded with the Interior Ministry; therefore, any problems of communication between departments or voting districts, or with the management of this information, are the fault of the government and the system, not the people, the nation’s citizens. The government must execute its duty without hesitation, especially since it spent millions of pounds modernizing the old identification card system through the use of giant computers.,,“If regulations concerning the digital management of information are not met in voting districts, then the government must step down and leave the matter to someone more capable, not use the situation as a pretext for instituting a new dictatorial regime that prevents the people from practicing their constitutional right.”,,Why all the hurry, when the government itself is not ready to allow all people to vote using their national ID cards without registration? New corruption?,,9. Confirmation of the constitution’s sovereignty over law: any allusion to any law that is actually a reference to the suggested temporary constitutional amendments should be deleted, and be accompanied not by this constitutionally corrupt expression which contaminates the constitution, but by regulations for the implementation of its articles—so that we don’t deceive the people again through laws that circumvent the constitution and falsify the will of the people.,,No to the trusteeship overseeing the temporary constitutional amendments! No to the trusteeship overseeing the establishment of a new constitution for the country! No to the suggested amendments!,,Since the committee appointed by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces did not assent to amend the constitution according to the demands of the people, let us reject it and return it to the committee once again, asking for new amendments that reflect our revolution’s goals, its true wishes, and the absolute right of the people to write their constitution.,,Revolutionaries…beware…the proposed amendments are nothing but the same model created by the supplanted president Hosni Mubarak and serve only as proof that the old regime lives on.,,The people want to write their own constitution, so that it is not stolen and transformed into tyranny all over again, and so that the days of anger don’t return.,,Observed:,This publication was printed thanks to donations from citizens, who took from their daily sustenance in order to make their brothers and sisters aware and spread the voice of the people; this is their involvement in the revolution.

Why Must SSIS Be Dissolved Now?,2011-03-20,2011,",The future can only be built until after the removal of the poisonous cancers of the past.,Everyone wants the fall of SSIS and this is a red line in the demands.,It is possible to redistribute the honorable ones among them within the police across the various units.,The state security apparatus controlled all aspects of life in Egypt, political, economic, and social, even cultural. It penetrated the parties. It controlled the election results with fraud and scandalous manipulation of the results. It penetrated the syndicates. It controlled the media. It controlled universities and student unions and the promotions of professors and teaching assistants and heads of departments in the educational system.,Likewise it interfered in judges’ actions and in the religious institutions.,It started to agitate sectarian strife to serve the agenda of those controlling it. It spied on our private lives and violated the sanctity of homes.,It manufactured black files for every official, big or small, and even normal people, to extort citizens and officials for their own benefit.,Its control reached the point that government employees were appointed and fired according to the decision of state security.,,,First: It monopolized power on every level and in every institution attached to the state.,Second: It ruined political life in Egypt with its corruption of official employees in districts and cities and provinces.,Third: With the agreement with state security, many officials were subjected to extortion, pay-offs, and financial dependence.,Fourth: The formation of militias of thugs to prevent voters from entering voting booths to make it easier to manufacture fradulent votes quietly.

Islamic Labor Party: Proclamation 15,2011-03-18,2011,",As we expected, the mighty Egyptian people that overthrew the great tyrant had no difficulty proceeding with the stages of revolution with the overthrow of the Shafiq government that had desperately tried to play the role of continuing the Mubarak regime without Mubarak. The Military Council has verified again that he has been dismissed according to the demands of the revolution. It has nullified this miserable government, and it has named someone well-known for his good qualities, nationalism, and his clean record, the engineer ‘Isam Sharaf. He is the reason for bringing the discussion at last to the stage of rebuilding after most of the structures of the corrupt regime have been toppled.,Historically, the work of popular revolutions has been divided into two stages: toppling the old regime and building a new society according to the principles of the revolution and in the framework of a new order.,The two stages overlap, of course: The head of the regime, who gathered most of the political and economic power, together with the country’s riches, in his hands, is overthrown. The presidency, the real source of executive, constitutional, and temporal powers so long as the freedom of judgment has been wrested from the minister of justice, is itself overthrown. The people shatter the central security and oust Mubarak’s ministers. The revolution purifies a number of popular and official institutions and organizations and gets the official media to recognize its marches. Both corrupt chambers of parliament are dissolved. The people take control of various rights and political freedoms in a very real sense. After all that and a lot more, we can say with confidence that the revolution has achieved most of its goals for toppling the old regime.,Now our call is to proceed with the special rebuilding stage after being made certain that a new government will be formed. (We are concerned about the appointment of al-‘Azabi, the current governor of Asyut, as Minister of the Interior, because he lead the battle to stymie the demonstrations of women in the opposition during March 2005). Our call is to proceed with the rebuilding of the Egypt that Mubarak and his cronies wrecked and destroyed in a manner unprecedented throughout history.,This is not to say that the process of overthrow has come to an end, for still ahead of us is: doing away with the state security’s secret police, ending the state of emergency, the immediate release of all political prisoners, securing the freedom to establish political parties and newspapers with due process, chasing down and bringing to justice the murderers and thieves who were or are a part of the executive powers and the National Democratic Party, as well as the thieves headed by Mubarak and his family who called themselves businessmen, dissolving the corrupt local representative councils, and dismissing the Mubarak-appointed governors.,But continuing the struggle to overturn the remnants of the regime will not consume all of the nation’s energies. We must set out right away to rebuild and to raise the slogan, “A hand for rebuilding and a hand for carrying weapons!” By weapons, we mean continuing the popular agitation for the realization of the revolution’s goals in terms of overthrow, that is, in terms of the aforementioned demands.,We ask the children of the people to desist temporarily from strikes demanding sectarian rights, even though they are reasonable in making those requests. This is not a call for the country to return to normal, because normal does not mean continuing injustices or being silent about them. Instead, a real response to these requests calls for the long-awaited national government to look into the general state budget that was undertaken on the basis of social injustice, and to reclaim pilfered funds here and abroad to fund wage and salary increases and urgent service plans such as building houses for young people and the homeless and to engage the greater part of these groups in productive capacities in a new beginning of the revival of the national economy and solving the problem of unemployment. And we calculate that if with God’s graces the transitional government should succeed in effecting tangible change on all these fronts over the course of several months, then we and other nationalists—outside of the ruling power—are in support of it with all the ideas and experience we possess.,,(And say [unto them]: Act! Allah will behold your actions, and [so will] His messenger and the believers).,Everlasting glory for our upright martyrs.,Shame and dishonor for Mubarak and his supporters.,Victory for the people of Egypt and their glorious revolution.,,Magdi Ahmad Husayn,Secretary General,Friday 4 March 2011,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162726im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Islamic-Labor-Party.png,imgID46,
"Voice of the Revolution, #7",2011-03-18,2011,"osition of waiting for the government to fulfill our demands. And this is contrary to what our experience has shown us; that popular struggle is the only way to achieve our demands. Thus, what we need is to lay out our demands clearly and then struggle for them as one, pursuing this manner until we force the Army and the government to yield to the demands of the masses. What has happened with the Security Forces is the clearest example of this. Since the victory of the Revolution, we have been demanding the dissolution of the institutions of the Security Forces and the arraignment of those responsible for this, but as no one has done anything, the masses have decided to take the reins of the matter and achieve their objectives.,What the Army did, while some consider it surprising, is only natural when you look at the nature of the Army. For although it came into power because of the Revolution, it was always part of the old regime, and its leadership was chosen by Mubarak when he ruled.,Therefore, we must have confidence in ourselves, in our struggle, and in the unions, confederations, and committees created to protect the revolution. These structures are able to express and defend our true desires.,The National Security Forces have not fallen yet,As thousands of Egyptians stormed the strongholds of the Secret Police of the National Security Forces, its soldiers were trying to burn the documents in order to erase the evidence of their acts of torture and murder that revealed that this organization not only was the actual ruler of Egypt but that it also planned many egregious violations of the rights of the country, the most glaring of which were the bombing of the Church of al-Qidiseen in Alexandria1 and the explosions in Sharm al-Sheikh.,Some, especially the agents of the counter-revolution, have tried to fool us into believing that there are secret police organizations in all countries of the world. However, the truth is that you do not find an organization above the law in the democratic countries of the world. The Secret Police own secret prison cells beneath ground, and they carry out acts of torture against political opposition of all varieties till the point of death, while they are not subject to any reckoning for their sins.,The storming of the strongholds of the Secret Police or the freezing of their operations does not mean that they have been defeated. The powers of the counter-Revolution will fight desperately in order to save this organization even if it has changed its name and adjusted the way it looks.,The old regime is still strong and ruling despite the fall of Hosni Mubarak and various markers of his regime. It is not a coincidence that the Armed forces have dealt with those who attempted to storm the stronghold of Lazughli with extreme violence including electric-shock and torture, because it has copies of all the documents from the other bases. The dissolution of the Secret Police is a goal that is as important as the removal of Mubarak! Therefore the struggle must continue to remove this organization so that it may never return.,,","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162817im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/VoiceoftheRevolution-MuslimsandCopts.png,imgID47,
Shame on the State Security,2011-03-18,2011,",Shame on the State Security,The protestors in Tahrir Square (Friday evening March 4, 2011) clearly and categorically refuse to break up their demonstrations before the demands of therevolution have been realized. They have tired of all the procrastination, the attempts tohijack the ability of the people to decide for themselves, and the lack of realization thatthere is a truth which has become evident: that what we have before us is a revolution ofmany integrated elements, not merely “ a tempest in a teacup” – that is, much ado about nothing, as had been imagined by the sick minds of some of the parasites of Mubarak’ sdictatorship, and the thugs of his State Security. On the contrary, life is now rich with theprocess of revolution, which throws punches in those ugly faces. Our peaceful protest, embodied by our unrelenting hold of Tahrir Square, is being followed by eyes in everystreet and alleyway, every factory and company, in Cairo and other cities of our country,just as it is being watched by the Arab masses in Benghazi, Zawiyyah, Tripoli, Aden,Sana’ a, Taiz, Manama, Baghdad, Muscat, and Amman. It represents the Mecca of allunderground revolutions, strikes, and protests, which are on their way from the Maghreball the way to Iraq. The protestors’ refusal to disband, which was a clear response to themere change of the president, incited some of the State Security officers and the trailingwaste of the fugitive National Democratic Party to assault a number of the protestors sitting in Tahrir Square on the evening of Friday, February 25, 2011. These were terribleand outrageous acts, expressing nothing more than the final frantic dance of a slain animal, and the State Security’ s terror at the mass scene surrounding the trial of the murderer Habib Al-Adli, the former Interior Minister.,From our end, we warn against the continuation of such dirty behavior, whose era,we believe, has now come to an end with the fall of the dictatorial regime. Should itcontinue, we will hold the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces – it being responsiblefor the nation’s security – entirely accountable for our reaction, which shall be fierce inthe face of any attempts to practice such disgusting behavior against the protestors.,Out of concern for the security of our country, we believe that the State SecurityInvestigations Service’ s (SSIS) behavior, which is carried out by thugs and thieves whofrequently resort to bullying and crime, just as they had become accustomed to doingduring the regime of the ousted dictator, will drive the country to consequences whichcould push it to its edge…,With regards to this matter, know that the Supreme Council’s refusal to grant ourrequest that the SSIS be disbanded as quickly as possible makes evident the hatred and animosity which fills their hearts for the people who carry the burden of theirsalaries. [As does] the continuation of their routine exercises of abuse toward thepeople, freedom, and the revolution and finally their attempt to obliterate or erasethe crimes they committed against the great Egyptian people by shredding thedocumentation, or burning the headquarters. They were built by funds cut from education, health, and housing budgets. [It is] as though [they are] burning a landbefore leaving it to the enemies.,Therefore, we believe that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has two choicesbefore it: either to take the initiative and immediately disband the State Security Investigations Services, to hand over those responsible for killing and terrorizing peaceful protestors to be tried in criminal court. Or [it can] announce its accountability for thecontinuation of the SSIS and carry the blame for the consequences pushing this nation to the brink.,","Regime, Security Forces",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155726im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ShameOnTheStateSecurity1.png,imgID48,

“The Crescent with the Cross”,2011-03-18,2011,"These days, memories of the revolution of the 19th–the Egyptian people’s revolution of the previous century–come to mind to bless the roaring, rebellious January 25th revolution, victorious against tyranny and its symbols, against corruption and its sins–to give Egypt its freedom back, and to let the Egyptians, one and all, hold their heads high with pride. The entire world bowed before the Egyptians’ courage and perseverance… We are touched by memories of the revolution of the 19th, in which the crescent embraced the cross, Father Sergius delivered a speech from the minbar of al-Azhar, and Shaykh Abu al-’Aynayn chanted and was welcomed at the Baklut Bey Cathedral…and in which Sa’d Zaghloul, when asked how two Coptic ministers could be appointed, said that bullets failed to separate Muslims and Christians on the 19th… Egypt witnessed the appointment of Butrus Ghali as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1937, the appointment of Wissa as the chairman of the House of Representatives, and the appointment of Makram ‘Abid as the Secretary General for the Wafd Party (majority party). Ghandi learned how the nation’s prejudices melted in the flames of the revolution so that Egypt could live free and independent. Today, now that their blood has mixed together in the glorious revolution of January 25th, the Egyptians will not allow anyone to break apart the sons of the nation who seized their own freedom.,The Wafd Youth confirms its demand for a just and democratic civilian country which protects the civil rights of all its citizens–their complete and equal rights and duties–and guarantees the application of law to maintain the honor of the nation and its people.,In the same vein, the Wafd Youth reject the amendments to the constitution of ’71 which will make the next president into a new dictator. They demand the implementation of a new democratic constitution for all people which guarantees rights of citizenship and a just, civil nation.,For this reason, we demand the cancelation of the March 19th Referendum.

We also beg them not to fall in line behind dubious parties who foment incidents of sectarian strife in their desire to cripple the revolution of our great Egyptian people.,We demand guaranteed actualization of citizenship and the establishment of a true civil state, and the negation of the objective causes that led to events like these.,By this we mean the ignorance and the poverty and the oppression and the disparity between social classes and preferential social and religious distinctions that impair Egyptians’ citizenship rights.,Lastly, the Revolution Youth Union affirms that this revolution will continue and that the Egyptian popular struggle is the best chance to solve the comprehensive crises from which society is suffering.

“The Basic Demand”,2011-03-15,2011,",,When millions of Egyptians went out on the 25th of January to gives themselves a voice and announce their main demand—the overthrow of the regime—the legitimacy of Mubarak, his regime, and his constitution, became null and void.,On the 11th of February, when Omar Suleiman announced the president’s resignation and theauthorization for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to administer the affairs of the country…….that authorization was from a president who had lost his legitimacy.,Thus, the legitimacy of the revolution has emerged to establish a new regime.

Experiences Away from the Spotlight,2011-03-15,2011,",“Experiences Far Away from the Spotlight”,[From Gurnal, Volume 1, Page 5],,I did not think for a moment when my friend asked me if I could travel to Bani Suwayf tomorrow. I have a strong desire for supporting counties far away from the spotlight, and for attempting to lift the curtain on what has happened and what might happen in these Egyptian villages.,We left Cairo at dawn on Wednesday, February 12 so that we could arrive to Rami’s house before nine in the morning. Rami, his friend, and his cousin had died as martyrs. At a modest house in the city of Biba, Rami’s family, his parents, his sister, his uncle, and his cousin greeted us. It was not long before a group of Rami’s friends joined us. We listened to what happened, to how eleven young men from the city had killed Rami. It was the same certainty and the same story that we heard in every house we went into that day.,His mother was interested in talking about how Rami had died one week after his birthday, a few days before his wedding. She opened a locked room; its walls painted a bright mauve adorned with a gold color. Rami had worked as an engraver. His room seemed to show me his mood, getting ready to welcome his wife. But they killed him. His only sin was that he had gone to take the injured to the hospital. May God take revenge upon them.,Let’s go back to the story of what happened on that bloody Saturday, the 29th of January. This is a story which does not cease to amaze me regardless of how often it’s heard and written about.,On this day, the secret police demanded that a group of youths go to the police station to pick up their motorcycles, which the chief detective had impounded, because he wanted to leave the department. The news of this spread throughout the region and young people convened there. Many of them bought motorcycles or rented them as a way to earn a living. Muhammad al-Dabsh confiscated them under the pretext [that they had committed] infractions and [amassed too many] fines. He asked for sums of money—as much as 1,000 Egyptian Pounds—to return the motorcycles. The complaints of the townsfolk were unsuccessful with the public prosecutor. There were more than 500 complaints against al-Dabsh but the prosecutor’s office was not interested in verifying any of them.,Almost 200 young men went out towards the police station but they were surprised by a hail of gunfire coming down upon them from every direction. They knocked down one man, covered in his own blood. When one of them ran towards him, they fired upon him and he fell next to the other man. Rami had not been involved with this crowd. He met up with them after one of his friends, who had been involved, asked for his help, saying: “The guys are workers; there are casualties by the dozens, we don’t know how to get them to the hospital”,Rami left the colors and al-Rula and ran to the scene of the crime to help his friend who had called him a few minutes ago. He had been struck by three bullets. He yelled, “You bastards! You killed ‘Akasha!” This was the first and last sentence [spoken] in this scene. No sooner had Rami leaned over to carry his friend than a bullet struck him in his right side, tore through his intestines and came out his lower stomach. At the same time, his cousin ‘Imad saw him fall, hit by gunfire. He ran towards Rami attempting to save him but he, too, was shot down by gunfire next to him. They left this world as they had lived in it, together.,Rami did not die at that moment, and one of the townspeople managed to carry him on a motorcycle “like a sacrificed animal”—as the locals would say. However, the hospital had not received instructions to get ready! Rami and the others went to Biba General Hospital but there was no one there to assist them. The doctors had run away. There were still desperate attempts to bring an ambulance from Zira’i Road. Forty-five minutes, however, were lost in vain before Rami and five others were put in an ambulance heading towards the Bani Suwayf General Hospital. The vehicle traveled for seven kilometers before Rami passed away.,The heroic chief detective, Muhammad Mustafa al-Dabsh, who had designed this trap for premeditated, intentional murder, had left his position as the chief detective of Biba to become the chief of the Drug Enforcement Unit in the Bani Suwayf province.,We went to the graveyard to see about the autopsy of these martyrs’ bodies. Most of them were buried without any kind of medical report or burial permit. I heard about Rami, ‘Akasha, and Ahmad. I had lived every detail of their [story] with their families only to turn and see them after their death. Their distinguishing characteristics had left them,. They resembled each other wearing a uniform fitted for pain. Oh how ugly this crime was!,I left Bani Suwayf shortly after 5:00 pm, yet Bani Suwayf did not leave me. The names of the deceased and the injured rang out in my ears, and the names of the officers harass my memory. ..The smell of death emanates from my body.,Our innocent children.,For a time we will not forget. For a time we will not let the murderers go unpunished. It might be that we forgive a police officer who makes a mistake by a verbal reprimand, but those who tortured, those who killed, those who planned, those who participated? Never. Personally, I will never forgive them even if it costs me my life.,Majida ‘Adali,,,________________,Acquired 8 March 2011,Translated by Elias Saba,Translation reviewed by Thomas Levi Thompson,« The Party of Change “Demands of the Revolution” »,You can be the first one to leave a comment.,Click here to cancel reply.,Tahrir Documents is an ongoing effort to archive and translate activist papers from the 2011 Egyptian uprising and its aftermath.

The Revolution is Still Ongoing,2011-03-11,2011,"[Page 1],Voice of the Revolution,February 18 Change…freedom…social justice Third Issue,Printed by a group of socialists Contact: [XXXXXXXX],,Thanks to the great Egyptian people’s resistance, the revolution’s first goal was realized, and the dictator was toppled. However, there are still numerous goals that we must realize. For when millions of Egyptians shouted “long live freedom, social justice,” they didn’t mean only the disposal of the dictator, but rather the regime, in all of its oppression, corruption, and poverty.,The battle isn’t over. The emergency law remains, which opens the door for the police to continue the policy of arbitrary detention and imprisonment without trial. The SSI remains present, which opens the door for torture practices and other means of oppression against political opposition. Thousands of political prisoners remain imprisoned without trial. The ministry is still full of symbols of corruption that the people disdain and blame for wasting their wealth. Billions of the people’s money remains stored in Swiss and Gulf banks. The dictator’s and his family’s money remains abroad, protected from any danger.,At the same time, the old regime strives to preserve itself, and to stop the success of the revolution at the minimum degree. However, the dignified life that millions of Egyptians hope for requires more fighting in order to cancel all the laws restricting freedoms, to change the structure of the police apparatus subordinating it to judicial supervision, to issue a constitution that achieves equality among all citizens, to return the smuggled money, to nationalize the companies which their owners closed in the face of the laborers, to change the current labor law that is completely biased towards business owners, and to take other steps down the path of equality and human dignity.,The path remains long. We must benefit from the unity and banding-together that was realized throughout the days of the revolution, and the beginning is gathering ourselves in linkages and associations and unions, in the working neighborhoods and sites, in order to defend our legitimate rights.,,","Regime, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141135im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Revolution3a-copy.png,imgID62,
The Nationalist Liberation Front: From the People to the People,2011-04-30,2011,"Nationalist Liberation Front,Freedom, Unity, Justice, Growth,,From the People to the People,A special vision to build an intellectual, organized Liberation Front,On February 7, 2011, from the core of the revolution, the heart of Tahrir Square, and the consciousness, ranks of intellectuals, and roaring freedom, came an idea to establish the “Nationalist Liberation Front.” After the people who created the revolution took in this idea, there had to be a moment of reflection. The idea is essentially centered on: What to do? What happens after the January 25, 2011 revolution? What kind of future do we want? How do we produce it? What is the Front’s vision for Egypt’s future in the upcoming years?,The people who produced the revolution with their conscious determination will know and realize that although the President fell on February 11, 2011, his regime has not yet fallen. He was building a frightening future of darkness without a vision for what was yet to come. People want the post-revolutionary period to be bright, blossoming, improving, just, and free for the present and the future.,Abstract:,The people are creators of the revolution, and likewise, the creators of the future,Indeed, the people are the creators of the January 2011 revolution. They themselves are able to create their own future. No one ever existed who has rightfully imposed his own individual view on the future of the people. The people are the creator of the future. He who dreams of the future that he wants, believes in, and knows how to create has a conscience full of excellence and a mind saturated with consciousness, awareness, and knowledge. His will explodes with pride, freedom, independence, and dignity.,The “Nationalist Liberation Front” does not present a ready-made vision for the future to impose on the people, individually or collectively. It is consciousness of the revolution’s necessity and awareness that the future we want in this country is a dream of the people and their creation. We must struggle together to bring this dream to light: a clear vision and an enlightening, organized, powerful, and cohesive thought as one indivisible nation working to upgrade specific programs—being cognizant, being part of something without being fanatical, and assuring justice for all without discrimination or bias.,Together, we build the future that we want,The Nationalist Liberation Front believes that it cannot share in building the future of Egypt unless it starts from the people because the future begins and ends with the people. The Front feels that during the building phases, “Together we build the future that we want.”,In order to implement this slogan during the phase of creating a foundation, we must work with and through the people to accomplish the coming tasks in accordance with a fixed, timely program:,,The First Task:,Building the Front’s Membership Structure,Organization Framework Philosophy:,The organizational framework philosophy of the Nationalist Liberation Front is based on the principle “from the people to the people.” The Front is considered the people’s party, launched from the core of the revolution for the benefit of the people and their future. It is an undertaking of construction from the bottom up by the people for the people. The operational experience of establishing people’s parties in the world proves that establishing these parties comes from the leadership’s loss of its popular features. It then devolves into individual parties that in turn revolve around the leadership. This circle suggests that leadership is always above the parties that create it, so that it then loses its popular, democratic condition.,We are talking about cadres working with and for the people. We are not talking about leadership that imposes its own views on the people.,Building the Nationalist Liberation Front needs to come from within the people by going to them in their far away villages, hamlets, and districts in Upper Egypt and the Delta prior to Greater Cairo, the coastal cities, and the urban areas. We need to establish a party of the people for the people for the future. The Front only holds the honor of taking the initiative and the responsibility to start and facilitate the implementation of the idea to establish a Liberation Front. The implementation of this mission will require devoted, careful, and faithful work. The result will be the rise of the people through the establishment of their own party, deriving from the goals, ambitions, and dreams of a generous, free, and just future. The program is set according to their pains and sorrows.,Indeed, the philosophical framework of the Front is from the people to the people, which requires us as a group to adhere to and abide by the following guiding principles:,1 – The greatest degree of transparency, clarity, and forthrightness,2 – The greatest degree of adherence to the principles and no deviation from them,3 – The people build their party from within and produce natural leadership that abides by the present imperatives and builds bridges of knowledge, development, growth, and freedom for the people’s future in the present and the future.,4 – The goals of the Front and its platform derive from the people—through them and with them, we will develop. Their fruits will be returned to them in the present and in the future.,5 – The cadre is merely a facilitator and a catalyst. The leadership will always rest in the people’s organized power, absolute consciousness, and guidance towards the future.,Building the Front is a task in time: Indeed, the mission of building the Front as a progressive national people’s party is a hard task. It will demand a number of sacrifices from those who believe in it. The requirement to build an actual party needs to be realized. If we do not act in a timely manner, we will create a weak party, disorganized on the organizational level and distorted and vague on the intellectual and programming level. We must work without delay so as to dedicate ourselves to the people. The one thing which we cannot give up is the popular standard of the party and its nationalism. This standard cannot be achieved merely with the availability of conditions for legal establishment. It goes further past that, and therefore it is our goal: Build a real party that deals with the issues of the people, preserves the revolution, and works with them for an agreed upon future based on parameters and goals called for by the people during the revolution. If we are beholden to this main criterion to build a party, it is certain to us that no contradiction can exist between the Front’s legal framework, which will not take more than 6 months to create, and the Front’s real framework, “from the people and to them.” This is a process of continual interaction and communication between the Front and the people who are the creators of the revolution and the leadership of the future.,Who are we?,The Second Task,Preparing Intellectual Documents and a Platform Specific to the Front,The “Egyptian” revolution happened. However, since its holy inception on January 25, 2011, who has been the leader of its cohesion, intensity, complexity, miraculousness, organization, and uniqueness among the different groups, communities, and classes of people? The real face of Egypt has shown itself by proving the ability of its genius people after patiently waiting for long, fruitless years to witness the collapse of the symbols, bodies, hordes of injustice, tyranny, corruption, oppression, ignorance, disease, humiliation, and backwardness.,The renewed and continuous “January Revolution” proved the ability of our great people. It produced a new code for the country, not deriving its source from the standing constitution or the current laws that kept, supported, and perpetuated the structure of corruption and tyranny. This revolution derives from the basis and source of the spirit of the people and the principles that they announced in Tahrir Square and all over Egypt. The “January Revolution” sprouted from fertile ground sown for the revolution. It revealed spectacular rights, wonderful manifestations that returned Egypt’s crown to decorate its head once again, freeing human dignity to permeate the atmosphere. Freedom, liberation, justice, and equality rose to encapsulate the heavens.,The Parameters:,The Nationalist Liberation Front confirms its full alignment with and deep belief regarding the success of the January Revolution. It now demands that we clearly and powerfully outline our revolutionary parameters—those that effectively formulated, guaranteed, and ensured that the revolution did not deviate from its goals at its peak—and prevent future deviations as far as increasing, rising, and opportunistic demands or attempts by the remaining corrupt regime to circumvent it. Thus, here are the parameters:,1 – Freedom first! A free person is he who creates the freedom of nations.,2 – Human dignity comes from the dignity of one’s country (dignified citizens in a dignified nation),3 – One country and one people,4 –Civil and democratic government,5 – Assurance of independence from the military institution,6 – Social justice is a life liberty. The path to the future is through comprehensive growth and the rise of society,7 – Comprehensive social growth comes from science, knowledge, justice, and equality,8 – Assurance of true Arab identity for Egypt and its presence in the future,9 – Preparation of the Egyptian role as the Arab, regional, and international pioneer,10 – Moving towards building a human world with more justice and equality,,The goals:,The parameters of the Tahrir revolution suggest goals in all their power, clarity, vision, and necessity: “Fundamental and comprehensive change of the prevailing regime and building a new political regime on the principles of freedom, unity, justice, growth, and equality,” which demands that the building of the Nationalist Liberation Front works with the people, continually struggling to achieve the following goals:,1 – Announcement of the unconditional end of the previous regime to the full, unconditional exclusion of even its smallest parts.,2 – Adherence to the continued revolution of liberation until the total collapse of the regime, which means working with the people to bring about the following goals:,-Adherence of the Court to justice, fairness, and due process regarding the head of the previous regime and all those involved in the corruption of political, social, economic, and press life in Egypt.,-Dealing decisively, in accordance with the laws, with the remnants of the counter-revolution. Its determined and insistent resolve to steal the revolution from the people has been proven by the experience since the revolution’s outbreak on the 25th of January.,-Establishing the Nationalist Liberation Front independently, focusing on the single task of working with the Arab people to get back the Egyptian’s stolen money.,-Fulfilling the demands of just punishment and thus assuring trials for all men who were leaders of the security apparatus, politicians, and those involved in the murderous crimes during the January Revolution and before it.,3 – Raising a true national discussion with and between all political powers with the goal to set the issues of the transitional phase and arrive at a national agreement for the future issues. Rejecting all attempts aimed at imposing unilateral views on the future.,4 – Recreating a new constitution for the country and completely guaranteeing the rights and general freedoms to the citizens, which include:,5 – Confirming Egypt’s Arab identity, its presence in the future, and its role in leading the nation to its goal of unity. Working for the rebuilding, reinforcing, and developing the role of Egypt as a pioneer in different roles—Arab, African, regional, Islamic, and international—in agreement with the best interests of the country.,Lift Your Head Up, You’re Egyptian,The people want to build the system,Together we Build a Liberation Front, Together we Build Egypt’s Future,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163542im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/National-Liberation-Front.png,imgID63,
The Filmmakers Occupying Tahrir Square,2011-04-30,2011,"The Filmmakers Occupying Tahrir Square,,We the filmmakers occupying Tahrir Square announce the following:,,We received a communication from the Chairman of the Filmmakers Guild on the evening of Tuesday, 8 February 2011. It requested that we include his name when issuing our statement of support to the January 25th Revolution, in which we supported the revolution and all of its demands—especially toppling of the president.The filmmakers who are staging the sit-in reject the change in the Chairman’s position. We are demanding an official announcement of his stance and that of his guild. He had promised to appear in Tahrir Square the nextmorning to sign any statement upon which these filmmakers agreed.,,On the afternoon of the 9 February 2011, Mr. Mus’ad Fawda came to Tahrir Square. The filmmakers requested a statement be written so that he could sign it.,,The filmmakers then wrote the following statement:,,“Believing in the right of the Egyptian people to realize all of their legitimate demands, especially toppling the Egyptian regime, the Filmmakers Guild announces the following:,,First: The resignation of the Chairman of the Filmmakers Guild and all members of the guild’s board as a protest against all of the oppressive practices of the corrupt regime. They must join all the honorable filmmakers with the Egyptian people in revolting against injustice and corruption. This resignation is a part of confirming that the current corrupt regime has lost its legitimacy andthat the Guild refuses to be a part of it.,,Second: The Guild dissociates itself from all statements, positions, and stances adopted by the Chairman and the Union of Artists’ Syndicates that spoke against the revolutionaries of the 25 January and supported the corrupt regime.,,Third: The filmmakers are joining the demonstrators in Tahrir Square. They are an integral part of the Egyptian people, and a part of the movement for change which supports all of the people’s legitimate demands, particularly the toppling of the president.,,Fourth: The filmmakers condemn the shameful stance of the state media that distorts the truth, deceives the people, and harms the reputations of the 25th of January revolutionaries. Similarly we demand the dismissal and trial of the Minister of the Media, Anas al-Faqi, ‘Abd al-Latif al-Minawi, the President of the News Sector, and all of the television and newspaper leadership which contributed to the regime’s conspiracy to brainwash the people, to its attempts to isolate the people from the revolution, and to insult the revolutionaries.,,Fifth: The confirmation that the protesting filmmakers will continue their demonstrations and protests byall peaceful means until every demand for reform and the establishment of a democratic civil state is realizedin Egypt.,,Sixth: The confirmation that the protesting filmmakers hold all members of the regime and its supporters responsible for the blood of the Revolution’s martyrs.,,“Long live the struggle of the Egyptian people….Long live the revolutionaries’ fight..Long live the blood of the martyrs…Long live Egypt.”,,Mr. Mus’ad Fawda refused to sign this statement because of the first clause, pertaining to his resignation and to that of the guild’s board. Because of this, the filmmakers who are protesting agreed upon the following: “The chairman’s refusal to present his resignation indicates that he is not in solidarity with the revolutionaries of 25 January. He is sticking by the system of the corrupt regime.

Get to Know the Captive Shaykh ‘Umar ‘Abd Al-Rahman,2011-04-29,2011,",Get to Know the Captive Shaykh ‘Umar ‘Abd Al-Rahman,,The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, “Any Muslim who abandons a fellow Muslim in a situation in which his wife offends against him and there is decrease in his land, God will abandon him in a situation in which he desires His help, and any Muslim who helps a fellow Muslim in a situation in which there is decrease in his land and his wife offends against him, God will grant him victory in a situation in which he desires His help.”,To every proud, free man from among the sensible and the distinguished, and to everyone who has mercy and humanity in his heart and stands up for human rights, get up and join us in the campaign to free Dr. ‘Umar ‘Abd Al-Rahman and demand that the Military Council intervene to release him.,Dr. ‘Umar ‘Abd al-Rahman in a few lines:,-The Shaykh is seventy-three years old; he was born in 1938.,-He obtained a degree in Religious Jurisprudence with excellence, summa cum laude, and was ranked first in his class. He obtained a doctorate from Al-Azhar University with excellence, summa cum laude, and worked as a graduate assistant at the college, then as an instructor.,The last visit to America:,-In 1990, Shaykh ‘Umar arrived in the United States and gained permanent residency as an imam and preacher.,-In 1993, a decree for his arrest was issued from the Ministry of Justice after Dr. ‘Umar publicly exposed Hosni Mubarak’s corrupt regime on major American channels such as CNN and others. All the tyrant Hosni Mubarak did at the time was meet with the American President Bill Clinton, demand Dr. ‘Umar ‘Abd Al-Rahman’s arrest, and invent accusations in exchange for letting many concessions (personal interests) go. Indeed, he leveled strange accusations against Dr. ‘Umar ‘Abd al-Rahman, accusations that no one with an atom of reason in him could understand; among them was his intention to assassinate Hosni Mubarak if he went to America. They prosecuted him according to his intention—while there is no law in the whole world with which to try someone based on intention. So, they took up a law that was in some cabinet, published during the American civil war 200 years ago, that sentences an individual according to his intention. On this fabricated accusation, they sentenced him to 285 years, i.e. life imprisonment.,There is a letter Shaykh ‘Umar sent in which he says:,“They are besieging me spiritually as well, in that they don’t let me have translators, readers, radios, and recordings…so I don’t hear any domestic or international news. They are besieging me in solitary confinement, and forbid anyone who speaks Arabic from coming to me, so I remain the whole day, the whole month, the whole year without speaking to anyone and without anyone speaking to me…and were it not for reciting the Qur’an, many psychological and cognitive ailments would have afflicted me…Another one of the ways in which they besiege me is that they have a camera on me day and night so that I have to expose myself to bathe or relieve myself, and they don’t hide that…additionally, they designate officers to watch me continuously, and they take advantage of my loss of sight to realize their depraved desires…They search me personally, so I have to take off my clothes and appear as my mother bore me, and they look at my private parts from in front and behind…and what are they searching for?? For drugs or explosives or anything like that; this offends me and makes me wish that the ground would break open and they wouldn’t do that to me…but as I said, they exploit the opportunity and thus defile a Muslim’s honor and pride. They don’t let me attend Friday congregational prayer, or pray with others, or attend holiday celebrations, nor do that let me have any contact with Muslims, even with my children—all of that they prohibit for me, and they offer deceitful excuses and create false pretexts. They treat me as poorly as possible and neglect my personal issues such as shaving and trimming my fingernails for months at a time. In addition, they make me wash my underwear, which means I’m the one who rubs soap on them, I’m the one who scrubs them, and I’m the one who spreads them out, while I really find things like that hard. Then I truly feel in a dangerous position, for no doubt they will kill me.”,What is being asked to do:,1. To learn more, go to Dr. ‘Umar’s website on the internet.,2. Work to spread this notice to get all free people to work with us.,3. The family of Dr. ‘Umar invites you all to a peaceful humanitarian demonstration in front of the American Embassy. Gather at 12 PM on Thursday, 4/21/11, in front of ‘Umar Makram Mosque in Tahrir Square. Your presence with us for this demonstration will strongly support the cause and let America and the army know that this is a popular demand and not the demand of certain individuals. America suggested to Egypt during the past regime that they release him, but the tyrant Hosni Mubarak refused.,","Prisoners, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155636im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Doctor-Abd-Al-Rahman.png,imgID66,

The Environmental Disaster in Mostorod,2011-04-25,2011,"Has the corruption gone. or is Gamal Mubarak still plundering the people, spending their wealth, and fooling around with the Egyptians’ health and spirits?,,The environmental disaster from the petrochemical project in Mostorod, an oil-producing area,(A project of one million killed in Mostorod),,The chain of acquisitions by Gamal Mubarak (the hidden owner of Citadel Capital) seeking to take over one of the most important pillars of the national economy, the oil sector, has been discovered. One of the links of this chain is the seizure of the largest oil-producing area in the governorate of Greater Cairo (the oil-producing area Mostorod) in addition to giant publically-owned oil companies that generate 5.5 billion EGP per year. He has done this to establish his ongoing enterprise which represents the biggest environmental problem in Cairo. It is a clear example of the gross squandering of public funds. This site contains a great number of landed assets and existing facilities. These represent (a large number of companies in the public sector) that are the foundation for the country itself and a source of income for thousands of workers.,,The current Oil Minister, ‘Abd Allah Ghurab, helps him with this. He previously signed a gas contract with Israel in his capacity as the president of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Now he is setting up the disastrous project in Mostorod for the welfare of Gamal Mubarak and his associates, who include: Ahmad Muhammad Hassanayn Haykal (son of the writer and journalist Hassanayn Haykal), Marwan Nabil ‘Abd Allah Al-‘Arabi (son of Foreign Minister Nabil ‘Abd Allah Al-‘Arabi), and others.,,The damaging environmental effects of the planned project (and) its launch within (the coming) days in Mostorod (the project of one million killed):,,*** According to the report issued by Institute of Environmental Studies at ‘Ain Shams University from the expert scientists in the field, there is extensive environmental damage from this project.,,","Mubarak and Family, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155459im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/TheEnvironmentalCrisis.png,imgID72,
"Dostour 2011, Vol. 3",2011-04-22,2011,"e wrote our revolution with our ideas,We wrote our history with our blood,We will write our constitution ourselves,,Number 3,,Pay Attention, Conscious People,Pay Attention, Faithful Army,,In short the decisive criterion—politically and legislatively— between the certainty of the revolution’s success or its being duped by the regime of toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak:,,The Decisive Criterion for the Success of the Revolution is the Use of the Term Constitutional “Declaration” Instead of Constitutional “Amendment”,,,The term “declaring” a new constitution means—politically and legislatively—that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces derives its power and legitimacy from the revolution that ousted the fallen regime. The regime of the toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak and his corrupt constitution fell because of the revolution. The term categorically denies that the source of the Supreme Council’s power to manage the affairs of the country comes from establishing new laws for a new regime whose authorization stems from Mubarak (the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces). We must also clarify that this authorization itself has been doubly voided: first because the toppled dictator had been violating—habitually—the constitution as a governing law for the rules of the transition of power (before the people deposed his corrupt constitution and regime); secondly, because any delegation or authorization issued by the dictator’s regime fell with him.,,As for the expression the “amending” of the constitution, this means—politically and legislatively—that the legislators of the old guard and their men (the tailors of those laws) have set up a legislative trap for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that must be avoided. Any decision that goes in the direction of “amending” the constitution means, legislatively, that the Supreme Council relies upon non-constitutional authorization and deception stemming from the toppled dictator—who was also overthrown by the revolution—as the source of its legitimacy in transitional power. Thus the revolution will fall.,,We do not intend for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to fall into this trap, which has been set for them by the political and legislative guard of Mubarak so that they re-inherit the governance. They would trade it amongst themselves every eight years instead of every thirty—causing us to once again live in corruption and to constantly relive the Friday of Cleansing. The hand of God, however, has stopped the old guard from ambushing and attempting to deceive the people and take command of the revolution. It did this by joining the army with the people in their successful revolution, which has ousted the toppled dictator, his regime and the corrupt constitution. Put quite simply, this means the nullification of any authorization of governance from the toppled dictator, as well as the void authorization, as we noted above. Oh you corrupt old guard: the Supreme Council of Armed Forces is much too smart for your lowly plan. This council shows us the true meaning of the army joining with the people in the revolution.,,The firm grip of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces—which we salute as the guardian of the revolution and democracy as reflected in all of its decisions until now—itself rips out any amendment to the constitution since it is a integral part of the revolution—the people and the army as one hand. Through the joining together of the army with the people—in the revolution— the overthrown constitution has lost all legitimacy. Since the bedrock for a new system—i.e., a new constitution—for the revolution is in providing the people with freedom, renewal, justice, equity, and the tools to create new progress and to put an end to the age of dictatorship and corruption, it cannot be completed in less than a year. This must be so in order that the next constitution profits from all of the beneficial lessons from the past thirty years. At that time, we will also have faith that the new regime will not forsake us. The only possible solution that can settle things in the direction established by our ideal revolution, from which we cannot refrain, is for us to “declare” a new constitution with systematic clauses for the transitional period. This way the creation of a new constitution for the country can be completed over the course of one year.,,As we have alerted the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces—which is politically conscious and has repeatedly announced its desire to transfer power to civilians as quickly as possible—this opportunity has been granted to us and there is no substitute for it now. A consequence of the army’s declaration of its union with the people in the revolution is that the legitimacy of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces as a part of the revolution as a representative of the Armed Forces, in light of the downfall and lack of legitimacy of all decisions issued by the supplanted dictator after the revolution. The revolutionary legitimacy upon which the governance of the country now depends does not emanate from previous regime at all.,,Any resolution without everything mentioned above represents the schizophrenia of authoritarian trickery. It could lead either to a new era of dictatorship and corruption or to the continuation of the instability that we want to address with radical solutions guided by the revolution and affirm as an anchor that cannot be lifted. The use of the word “stability” is not an invitation to deception—as the supplanted dictator taught us throughout thirty years of corrupt stability and—as the corrupt old guard wants to dupe us now.,,No to Amending the Constitution The people Want the Declaration of a New Constitution So That They Are Not Stolen From and Tyrannized Once Again,,(page 2),,Worksheet for the New Constitutional Declaration and the Next Phase,,We respect the desire of the Armed Forces to transition power as soon as possible to a legitimate power accepted by the Egyptian people. Thus we suggest that the tasks of this transition—in order to achieve peace for the people and guarantee the stability and future of the country—be arranged as follows:,,First: Paving the Way to Declaring a Constitution Starts with Legitimacy from the Revolution,,(So that it is not repelled by a lack of legitimacy, as is the case with the current suggested amendments to the overthrown constitution),,A—That the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, according to its rights and responsibilities, undertakes the issuing of legal decrees for managing the country’s affairs until the election of a presidential council. The council will complete the legitimacy of governance in this transitional phase, as previously stated.,,B— That the Supreme Council of Armed Forces undertakes—as quickly as possible—the call to elect a presidential council. The elections rolls should represent the various constituencies and age groups. This will ensure that the legitimacy of the decisions of the transitional period are realized and that we can truly and immediately anchor our revolution in democratic law not a dictatorial philosophy in which the ideas of a small group of pre-revolutionary intellectuals decide the fate of the majority.,,C— That the Leadership Council, according to its rights and responsibilities, issue legal decrees immediately upon its election for managing the affairs of the country. They will continue to rule until the inauguration of a new constitution, one year after its transition to power, since the affairs of the country are considered transitional until the election of the country’s new president.,,D— That the legally decreed duties of the temporary presidential council include a commitment to conducting an election of a national organization—also temporary—whose role is limited to framing the constitutional declaration, after its commitment to recording, guarding and discussing the suggestions presented by citizens who wish to do so.,,E—That state television be committed to allotting and appointing one of its channels to transmitting the discussions about the content of the new constitution live on the air in addition to broadcasting it over the internet and in newspapers. This is in order to bring tranquility to the streets, and so that awareness and transparency are achieved.,,F— That the elected presidential council commits to the formation of a national unity government for the transitional period immediately upon its election.,,G— That the issue of a legal decree that calls for professional associations to elect their administrative boards after the current boards becomes illegitimate, in accordance with the ruling of the Constitutional Supreme Court regarding the unconstitutionality of law number 100, which organizes elections of professional associations.,,Second: Laying out the Temporary Constitutional Declaration,,Within one month its inauguration during the transitional period—and after committing to receiving and recording suggestions from those members of the people who wish to submit them—the presidential council commits to presenting the new constitutional declaration for a popular vote. On the condition that the following reforms are included:,,A—The Constitutional Declaration binds the elected presidential council to call for the election of a constituent national group. This group should represent the various constituencies and the groups above the legal majority to make up a truly proportional representation. It will put in place a new constitution for the country that reflects the hopes for constitutionally-entrenched democracy.,,B—The constituency group is required to receive the suggestions of the people. It is required to record them, announce them, safeguard them, and discuss them using a variety of different media, in order to achieve complete transparency. So it can benefit from the all experiences and from able minds in establishing the constitution, pushing forward the wheel of progress, achieving justice and the will of the people, and struggling against corruption.,,C—The elected constituency group is required to elect a number of constitutional scholars to join into the group in order to benefit from their experience. They will frame the new constitution—after the constituency group has determined its articles—in a sound constitutional form.,,D—Voting on each article of the new constitutional declaration, or in any election, shall be by use of the National ID for all who have reached the age of 18—without any other condition or prior registering—under shared judicial and popular supervision that specifies electoral mechanisms. In a similar the new rules for the direct rule of political rights are established.,,E—Special articles for the regulations for nominating and electing the President of the Republic as well as guarantees of the integrity of these elections.,,F—Specifying the powers granted to the office of the President of the Republic.,,G—The new national constitution protects, democratically and constitutionally, the highest guarantees and constitutional articles:,,H—The constitutional declaration specifies the deadlines and configuration of presidential elections in a limited time frame following the decision of the people on the new constitution. This guarantees the ratification of the new system before the arrival of the new president and avoids the use of any influence in the determination of the new constitution. Then will follow the elections of the People’s Assembly. This will also gives youth and the emerging political power the opportunity to prepare to run, instead of giving the sterile pre-revolutionary political power an unjust opportunity for exploitation and for building up their dominancy in the People’s Assembly. Such an event would impede a better age, as it has been for the past thirty years.,,Observed:,This publication was printed with voluntary donations from citizens taken from their daily sustenance in order to make their brothers and sisters aware and to spread the voice of the people.

Will we wait for the time when Jerusalem is completely Judaized and the honorable al-Aqsa mosque is destroyed?,The youth of free Egypt, interested in restoring Jerusalem once again as the beacon of the Arab world, since our dream of praying at al-Aqsa mosque brings us together, have decided to support the Palestinian intifada by way of the following:,Our date is Friday, May 13th, 2011, in Tahrir Square,May the mercy of God be upon our dear martyrs who have granted us the opportunity for freedom and change.,Help us distribute this page on Facebook:,www.facebook.com/masri.falasteny,(I am an Egyptian for the intifada),","Palestine, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153104im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/For-all-who-believe-in-the-issue-of-palestine.png,imgID74,

Lotus Revolution Coalition: Press Release,2011-04-22,2011,",The great Egyptian people carried out the January 25th revolution and offered sacrifices and martyrs. The present circumstances are characterized by numerous human rights violations—by way of unjust Military Court rulings or by way of expiatory fatwas—which are both ways to terrorize the Egyptian away from freely expressing their opinions. Due to the retaining all the freedom-restricting laws until this day and due to the existence of counter-revolutionary forces (embodied in remnants of the old regime), talking about any elections is an attempt to steal back the revolution and circumvent its achievements. We therefore demand:,1. Bringing to trial all of the former regime’s figures of corruption, in particular Safwat al-Sharif, Fathi Surur, Zakaria ‘Azmi, and most importantly the ousted president Hosni Mubarak. Reclaiming the country’s money.,2. Forming a temporary presidential council which immediately assumes power and conducts presidential elections first.,3. Releasing all political prisoners.,4. Ceasing the trial of citizens under Military Courts, and holding accountable those responsible crimes of torture that are ongoing.,5. Affirming the freedoms of expression, peaceful demonstration, and not issuing any law that restricts popular opinion or protests.,6. Purging the media of those responsible for misleading the people,for the media blackout, and for accusing the revolution of treason.,7. Dissolving the NDP which was among the most important causes of political corruption in Egypt and turning their money and their headquarters over to the state.,8. Liberating district establishments, local councils and universities from their heads who belong to the remnants of the NDP or agents of State Security.,9. Terminating the emergency laws, and voiding all laws that restrict freedoms.,XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX,XXXXXXXXXX,,","Calls to Protest, Media, Movements, Revolution, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153830im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PressRelease-LotusRevolutionCoalition-copy.png,imgID77,
Yes or No to Constitutional Amendments?,2011-04-21,2011,",Page 1: Yes to Constitutional AmendmentsPage 2: No to Constitutional AmendmentsPage 3:,Because your vote will make a difference in your country’s future,(Pre-revolution, it was idle talk. Post-revolution, it’s for real.),,Because participating means change, and coffee-shop discussions mean…nothing at all.,,No,To the Constitutional AmendmentsThe AmendmentsThe majority agrees on the proposed amendments. But the majority also demanded a new constitution. So why are we amending articles of a constitution the revolution has overthrew and which has lost its authority?,StabilityStability will not come through voting “yes” and “Let’s return to how it was.” Stability is voting “no” so we can have a new beginning on a sound basis.,The People’s AssemblyAgreeing to the referendum means agreeing to hold parliamentary elections in a very short time (only two months), which only allows the Muslim Brotherhood and the remains of the National Democratic Party to win in the elections. It does not permit other powers, such as the youth of January 25th and others, to organize their ranks or found other parties representative of the rest of the people’s beliefs. Agreeing to the amendments also means agreeing to hold elections before security has returned to the entire country and acts of thuggery continue, which will expose the electoral process to dangers. In other words, even when there were police everywhere in the streets during the previous elections we saw thugs overturning the country; what do you think will happen when we hold elections while the thugs are in the street day and night, and security is still absent from many areas?The New PresidentYour agreeing to the constitutional amendments means you agree to presidential elections that will bring to power a president with absolute powers (meaning he’ll be able to do whatever he wants without the law keeping track of him, and whoever tells you otherwise is just mocking you).,Page 4:,The New ConstitutionIn either case, whether the majority agrees to it or or rejects it, a new constitution will be written for the country. If you said “yes,” the new constitution will be framed by a president with absolute powers and a parliament that doesn’t represent the Egyptian people. Whereas “no” means that all the people’s groups will share in making the new constitution for the country. And it doesn’t make any sense to demand that the president then agree to a constitution that limits his powers (that’s like putting your neck in some one’s hands and saying: “Well, maybe he’ll turn out to be a nice guy…),The Uncertain FutureHow can you allow anyone to make you fear the future and convince you that everything will be uncertain… refusing the constitutional amendments is the first step on the way to a constitution that represents Egypt in its entirety.

A Revolution of the People,2011-04-19,2011,"A Revolution of the People,,A letter to the military council from the Egyptian people behind the revolution:,,Sorry, your credit has run out. Return to your residencies; we want a civilian presidential council. Your decisions are slow. Our demands were not achieved; it’s as if the people died. You accuse us of slowing down production. We have nothing to do with that since our popular demands are just. You demand that we reconcile with those who are still fighting the revolution and create discord among the people. They have not apologized for the courage they lack; slow and unserious about recovering money looted here and abroad. This makes us distrustful, because as of now we have not seen any real efforts to address these issues. The delay in achieving security shows the likelihood of cooperation between you and the police, which also makes us distrustful. Although you are capable of addressing these issues, you have not. Dissolve the local councils. Remove the conservatives along with all leaders loyal to the regime. Liberate the Egyptian media from all of directors loyal to the former regime and from all guardianship and guidance. So that it can give its true message to the people without leaving things out or glossing over facts and without the influence or threats of private channels. You interfered with amending the constitution and entrusted a committee with it. You set the date for the referendum, the method and ate for voting. All of this along with your constitutional announcements betrays your inexperience to even those who think the best of you. Moreover, this clearly resulted in dilemmas about spending wasted time and effort for useless arguments and disputes, representative of what Hosni Mubarak did with tirelessly. Do not criminalize demonstrations and sit-ins. Protect those participants from gangs. Fulfill our demands. We want the Attorney General – a lawyer for the people – to try all figures of corruption, starting with Mubarak, his sons, ‘Azmi, al-Sharif, Surus, Husayn Salim, and others in a public trial that’s both expedient and transparent. He should not stop until he tries the last issue of corruption and the last corrupt official who was allied with the regime. This is what you must do at the very least so that the people find you trustworthy. No one will be able to take away our revolution and we are ready to die for the cause. We want the dissolution of the National Party that continues to interfere with the destiny of the people.,,God says: “When God helps you, then none can overcome you”.

Call for the Foundation of an Egyptian Council for Relief,2011-04-18,2011,",Call for the Foundation of an Egyptian Council for Relief,,,In the framework of the Egyptian people’s suffering throughout the past thirty years from the stealing, plundering, and wasting of its blood domestically and abroad, practiced by the previous corrupt government without conscience and with utmost harshness and barbarity, I was driven to the necessity of taking strong and tangible measures—far from condemnation and criticism—to protect the rights of the nation and its citizens. Therefore, I, Dr. Mohamed Farouk Mohamed Darwish, representative of the founders of the Egyptian Council for Relief, am honored to invite every free and honorable Egyptian, no matter his position, to join this council under the following conditions:,,First: the essence of the Egyptian Council for Relief,,The Egyptian Council for Relief is a popular charitable organization which does not seek any unlawful gains and is not in any way associated with any establishments of the official government. Its board of directors is appointed through free, direct elections by the general assembly, and its primary goal is the protection, rescue, and relief of Egyptians wherever they may be, whether in Egypt or abroad. It is self-funded through the subscriptions, endowments, and monetary and material donations of Egyptian individuals, NGOs, and societal groups, as well as gifts and contributions in kind from foreign NGOs inside and outside of Egypt.,,Second: the conditions of membership in the council,,1) The member must have Egyptian citizenship, and any club, organization, or institution must have Egyptians, whether in the Arab Republic of Egypt or abroad.,2) The age of the individual member must not be less than 21 at the time of his enrollment.,3) The individual member must have either served in the military or be temporarily or permanently excused from military service.,4) The individual member must be well-mannered, without any criminal records, and participating groups must have a good record, clean of convictions of political and fiscal corruption, bankruptcy, liquidation of its assets, and tax evasion.,5) The individual must pay a one-time establishment subscription of 100 Egyptian pounds, after which the renewal fee will be 50 pounds per year. Participating groups must pay a one-time establishment fee of 250 pounds, after which the membership renewal fee is 150 pounds annually.,,Third: the Purposes of the Council,,1) The prediction of disasters via precise studies, and the attempt to prevent these disasters by any means possible.,2) The relief of Egyptians and the management of crises in Egypt and abroad in the event of a disaster, and providing Egyptians all possible means of aid and material support, such as evacuating and freeing Egyptians, if need be, and returning them to Egypt. This also includes but is not limited to: the event of war, plane crashes, sunken ferries, traffic and train accidents, earthquakes, landslides, collapsed buildings, trapped people, genocides, terrorist, extremist and sectarian attacks, kidnapping, piracy, acts of revenge and more.,3) Gathering all the data and assets (both in and out of Egypt,) of those who fled who are convicted of humanitarian crimes (whether convicted by the people or the judicial system), including: embezzling and looting public funds, mass murders and war crimes, and political and administrative corruption harmful to the public interest. Presenting the data and assets to the justice system in order to take the necessary legal measures to restore stolen wealth to the nation, return convicts to Egypt, bring them to justice, and return the right of the robbed people.,4) Helping those unable to do so in filing compensation claims for the loss of their family members and livelihoods, with the required data and supportive documentation, and in mandating defense attorneys to defend their rights, as well as to help all unable groups demand their legal rights.,5) Any other acts for which the need may arise for the benefit of the nation and its citizens.,,Fourth: The Sources of the Council’s Funding:,,At the time of this council’s establishment, its permanent headquarters, and its branches both domestic and abroad, as well as the allocating of expenditures on all of its previous primary items, including administrative aspects and the production of membership identity cards, the following sources of funding have been determined:,,1) Establishment and yearly subscription fees for individual members and group memberships both in Egypt and abroad.,2) Donations and endowments from individual members and group memberships in Egypt and abroad.,3) Material donations only, not financial, may be accepted from international donors in the form of tools and equipment for the relief effort, in order to prevent foreign interference and influence on the council’s decisions.,,Fifth: Forming the Governing Board of the Council,,The governing board of the Council is made up of eleven individuals: the president, vice-president, and nine members. They are followed by numerous committees, which are staffed only by those with expertise and who are able to carry out its missions, which include but are not limited to:,1) The committee for the relief of acts of extremism, terrorism, sectarianism, and revenge.,2) The committee for the relief of acts of kidnapping and piracy, and to save hostages and free them.,3) The committee for the relief of plane, boat, and train wrecks, as well as any other accidents of other forms of transportation.,4) The committee for the relief and evacuation of victims of war and genocide and those stuck in catastrophes.,5) The committee for relief from earthquakes, landslides, and structural collapses.,6) The committee for the gathering of information on fleeing convicts and their wealth.,7) The committee of law and defense on behalf of people who are unable to demand their legal rights.,8) The committee for the study of disasters, the prediction of catastrophes before their occurrence, and crisis management and negotiation.,,Lastly, Dr. Muhammad Faruq calls for all noble citizens to be quick in joining the Council to immediately start executing the Council’s missions. Currently the highest priority is to save more than a million Egyptians stuck at the Libyan-Tunisian border without shelter, food, water or medicine, which poses an imminent disaster for them, their relatives, and all of Egypt… May God grant you success.,,,,Dr. Mohamed Farouk (Representative of the Council’s Founders),Ph.D. in National Security – The United States of America,Vice President and National Security Advisor for the Arab Republic of Egypt for the European Economic Chamber,Cell phone: 0160633333 Fax: 27537486,,,E-mail : info@egy-cou-rel.com www.egy-cou-rel.com,","Libya, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153348im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/CallForTheFoundingOfAnEgyptianCouncilOfGrowth.jpg,imgID81,
The Great People of Egypt,2011-04-17,2011,",The Great People of Egypt,,The people of Egypt did not undertake their great revolution—for which they sacrificed copious amounts of blood and the dearest of martyrs—in order to simply exchange one tyrant with another. Rather, they did it in order to breathe the sweet smell of freedom, taste the nectar of honor, and bring to fruition their right to decent living and a good, prosperous life.,If today those who are supported by the people as protectors of the revolution, those who are appreciated for their role in the success of the revolution, and those who understood for the pressures and obstacles that they face, were to come to power, only to hijack the people’s revolution, intentionally circumvent the revolution’s goals, and empty it of its meaning and purpose, there would be no choice but to take a decisive and forbidding stance. There would be no choice but to make them return to their senses and realize their role and the burden of this trusteeship, or surrender the responsibility to someone who represents and pleases the people.,We have evidence that makes us doubt the gentlemen residing over the matters of this country, in terms of their loyalty to the revolution and to the people. For none of the following acts satisfy the aspirations of the people: their sluggishness in sending the heads of the previous regime to trial, leaving them at large to wreak havoc and corrupt the land; their use of torture, beating, and thugs similar to that of the former regime; the implementation of martial laws against peaceful protesters, laws which are in and of themselves an insult to the revolution – such as the laws which make it a crime to stage protests, sit-ins, and strikes, and laws which grant amnesty in exchange for money – and finally a constitutional declaration. The list goes on.,So the question is: how can we trust in an authority that claims belief in the revolution, then lets the corrupt go or tries them before a civil court, whereas protesters are tried in martial court? How can we trust in an authority which makes it a crime to host protests, sit-ins and strikes that hinder business, when the revolution itself was staged upon this basis? This leads one to question what types of strikes are allowed under this authority. How can we trust in a power that aids with an amnesty law those who stole and looted the sustenance of the Egyptian people? “For if anyone of high rank committed theft among them, they spared him; and if anyone of low rank committed theft, they inflicted capital punishment upon him.” So if you want to steal, steal billions, for if you steal pennies you will go to jail, whereas with billions, you can buy your freedom and escape punishment.,Therefore, out of our belief in the revolution and the interests of the people, we demand the following:,,Sons of our great people, we address the spirit of honor and love of country and the blood of its martyrs in each one of you: let us continue in this revolution until it reaches its end. For the government will either submit to the will of the people, far from any internal pressures, interests, or commitments, and far from foreign dictates, or let the revolution continue until the government becomes the true and valid government of the people.,,,The Union of Egyptian Socialist Youth,,,,Visit us on facebook at: http://www.facebook.com/egy.socialist.youth,,","Solidarity, Unions",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152957im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/THE-GREAT-PEOPLE-OF-EGYPT.png,imgID82,
Coalition of Youth Revolution: Invitation to Save the Revolution Friday,2011-04-16,2011,"We want our right…our money and our blood,Yes…we seek stability…and we want a return to normal life and security in the street…However, we are devoted to rebuilding what was destroyed during the thirty years that passed as we progressed backwards…In fact, we demanded calm and stopped the million man marches in Tahrir in order to give the government and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces a chance to fulfill the demands of the revolution and achieve stability―real stability that can’t be achieved without cleansing corruption and its symbols from the former regime, not the false stability that Mubarak sought to preserve….Yes we want to focus on building on peaceful foundations and rules; we want a stable atmosphere in which we can progress forward without turning back; we don’t want to seeing everywhere around us the evidence of suspicious actions that distract us from building and seek to return the country its pre-January 25th state… However, we have to be alert as we build, so that the revolution will not be stolen from us. Our urgent attention to work, evolution, and initiative for calm should not prevent us from asking ourselves:,What does it mean that in a recent interview, Ahmad Fathi Surur acted as though he were an initiator of the January 25th Revolution, while he has still not been summoned to trial in the ongoing investigation of his actions planning the ‘Battle of the Camels?’ What does it mean that Zakariyya ‘Azmi appears on television to announce that he is currently managing the affairs of the presidency? And what does it mean that the name Safwat al-Sharif also appears in reports regarding the Battle of the Camels, yet he too has not summoned for any investigation?!,What does it mean that small-time thugs are being brought to trial before military courts, which issue urgent and restrictive verdicts against them, while several of the instigators themselves are tried in normal courts under petty charges, their cases postponed time and again? And that the chief instigators haven’t even been summoned for investigation?!,What is the meaning of the delay in requesting that the assets suspected figures, chief among them Mubarak’s family, be frozen? And what does it mean that the request that was sent contained errors which delayed the freezing process and led to some nations’ rejection of the proposal…while we are in dire need of those funds to solve our current economic crisis?,What does it mean that these transformers left their holes after having changed their skin, and that the NDP held a conference to prepare for the upcoming parliamentary elections, as though the revolution never happened?!,What does it mean that the people remain distracted and factionalized by the referendum’s battle of ‘Yes’ vs. ‘No,’ while not all of the demands of the revolution have been fulfilled, the one who spilled the martyrs’ precious blood has not yet been held accountable, and the proper measures to restore our stolen money have not yet been taken?!,What is the meaning of the draft law issued to prohibit assembly and sit-ins, written in loose terms that could apply to all types of protests? What does it mean that the Faculty of Media was stormed in an effort to disperse the student and faculty sit-in there demanding the departure of their dean, a leader of propaganda campaigns for the NDP and the former regime? What does it mean that some of the revolutionaries and people sitting-in at Tahrir are being tried in military courts, made subject to thuggery law, and tortured as detainees…given all this, what does it mean to say that this flexible law will not target assemblies other than those that disable the wheel of production?!,What does it mean to slow down what should be sped up, to use extraordinary measures to handle normal matters, while normal measures are used to handle important, extraordinary, urgent matters? What does it mean to apply the law by imposing it on those to whom it explicitly stated it would not apply?!,We realize that these and other questions stop us all, taking our focus away from building…. And we realize that if we let the fulfillment of the revolution’s demands proceed at this rate, we might find ourselves returning to what was before January 25th, with the same leaders’ faces everywhere, despite claims of transformation, and the same pre-prepared climate of corruption and depravation.,Yes, we will build and continue to build, but without speedy, resolute purification and trying the heads of corruption, our effort will have been in vain.,Yes, we will build and continue to build, but building won’t make us forget the demands of the revolution that have not yet been fulfilled.,So let’s stand together on ‘Save the Revolution Friday,’ April 1, 2011 in Tahrir Square, so that the revolution is not stolen from us before our eyes.,,Together One People Imposes Its Demands and Does Not Request Them,Together toward a speedy and exceptional trial for Ahmad Fathi Surur, Zakariyya ‘Azmi, Safwat al-Sharif, and all the heads of corruption…,Together toward the adoption of urgent and effective measures to return our stolen millions in support of our economy…,Together toward speedy and decisive accountability for all those who participated in killing our martyrs through action, incitement, or conspiring…,Together let’s liberate state television and the national newspapers from the spokesmen of the regime who continue to run them; let’s redirect its compass towards the revolution…,Together let’s liberate our institutions―provinces, local assemblies, and universities―from the remnants of the NDP and state security agents who continue to run them…,Together with resolve, so that the revolution isn’t stolen from us…,Together…’one hand,’ always and forever,Coalition of Youth Revolution,,","Calls to Protest, Movements, Revolution, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163940im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CoalitionofYouthRevolution.png,imgID83,
Egyptian Communist Party: “No to Outlawing Protests and Strikes”,2011-04-16,2011,"After many long decades of seige, repression, and falsification of the masses’ will under the the totalitarian National Party’s hegemony and the now obsolete dictatorial regime’s police state, and after the sucess of the Egyptian people’s revolution and its aspiration to create a new and democratic political system that grants the freedom to form political parties, unions, and associations, as well as the right to strike, sit-in, and peaceful protest, the masses of Egyptian people were surprised at the issuance of a decree by the military council that criminalized the right to strike, protest, and sit-in―these being the revolution’s primary tools―and the issuance of a law on March 28th which altered in a top-down and ad-hoc manner some of the legal articles and clauses concerning the organization of political parties, without communal discussion with the parties, powers, and organizations concerned in these laws, and without consulting any of the jurisprudence or alternative projects these powers have presented and released for many years. All of this confirms the fear that the same arrogant and insulated practices of the former regime will continue―practices which stand in utter opposition to the spirit and direction of the revolution, during which hundreds went out into the streets to demand freedom and democracy.,Although there is one positive thing in the new amendments to some of the articles and clauses of the political party law―namely article number eight, which calls for the formation of a Parties’ Committee composed of judges, instead of the previous comittee composed of ministers and officials appointed by the President of the Republic―the amendments to the new law leave unchanged many of the old laws’ restrictions; indeed, new restrictions have even been added, representing a dangerous setback on the path towards developing the democracy for which the revolution strove.,The rumor currently circulating―that the new law allows for the formation of parties with nothing more than notification―is not true. Its clause prohibits the formation of parties except in two cases: either with a license approved by the Committee, or after thirty days have passed since the original date of notification, if the Party Committee doesn’t object. The law also limits appeals on the Committee’s decision―even though it is an administrative committee―to only one level, the Administrative Court, which is an infringement of the right to appeal on two judicial levels stipulated by the constitution.,In 1977, the law stipulated that each party had to have fifty founding members to release a notification; then, in 2005, this number increased to one thousand. Now, under this new decree, the minimum number of founding members has increased fivefold, expanding to five thousand members from ten governates, with each governate containing no fewer than three hundred members. Before it can be registered, the party must also publish the names of every single member in two widely-circulated daily newspapers, a requirement that could cost the would-be party almost one million Egyptian pounds. What kind of political party begins its activities with such a huge number of members, such widespread fame, and such massive resources, unless the law’s intent was to set up restrictions that prohibit the formation of political parties that speak for proletariat classes and groups, as well as the youth communities that played the chief role in the revolution? Why this fear that tens of parties will be formed, after these long decades of deprivation and expropriation? Let the one criterion for judging the survival or demise of the parties be the will of the people and nothing else, as in all democratic countries.,Additionally, article four (secondly) of the new law maintains the vague terms present in all of the notorious laws that restricted freedoms throughout the age of Mubarak and Sadat, such as: “The protection of national unity and social peace.” These are expressions that the Constitutional Court rejected because they carry a number of possible meanings. In the same article (thirdly)―despite the democratic powers’ agreement that political parties not be formed on the basis of religion, since this is in conflict with the essence of a civil state based on citizenship and equality before the law, without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or gender―we oppose this article’s stipulation prohibiting the formation of political parties on the basis of class (the same text laid down in the previous laws from 1977) because it destroys the central motivation behind forming political parties at all. Society contains various classes and groups whose interests conflict with one another; it is therefore natural that parties be formed as a political expression aiming to defend the interests of a specific class or class alliance, so that class struggle can be managed in a peaceful and democratic way. In every country in the world, since political parties were first formed up through the present moment, there are leftist parties that defend the interest of the proletariat and the poor, just as there are right-wing parties that defend the interests of capitalists and the rich.,Our party, in addition to many other national and democratic forces, will resist this law, just as we have resisted all previous oppressive regimes, affirming that revolutionary law ensures for all parties the freedom to practice and express their views. It is the responsibility of the new laws to coincide with this revolutionary law, not stand in opposition to it. Regrettably, this new law reveals a position contrary to the principles on which the revolution was based and the goals for which it strove―namely, to develop and stimulate political life after decades of stagnation and devastation.,For this reason, our party calls on all parties and powers, political and youth organizations as well as civil society groups, to stand in one rank against this law, resisting any measures and decrees that prevent the masses from exercising their right to political and democratic action that both conform to the precepts of the revolution and bring to fruition the interests of the masses who made it possible.,Tuesday, 29 March 2011The Egyptian Communist Party,,","Politics, The Egyptian Communist Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152103im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/NoToOutLawingProteststsandStrikes.png,imgID84,
The United,2011-04-15,2011,"About the United:,The United is a group that was secretly founded during the sit-ins in Tahrir Square on the 30th of January, when political parties and groups in the square were at odds with each other, and were trying to convey only their opinion and not others’ opinions, at the beginning of the Revolution.,The Revolution was nearly beset by chaos, disorganization, disintegration and discord until the idea of founding a group called “the United” came to us.,This means a group that includes prominent members from each party and group such as “the Wafd (Delegation) Party- the Muslim Brotherhood-the April 6th Movement-We are all Khaled Said-the Nasserist Party-the Tomorrow Party (al-Ghad)- the Reform Party and others…”,Presiding over this group was an independent member not belonging to any side or political group. The word “presiding” here does not mean “ruling or leading” but means organizing, for true leadership in the group means that the majority is involved in decision making.,,The goals of the United: To consolidate all political views into unified opinions, steps and solutions, agreed upon by all sides, in order to face all the issues both in and out of the square. Also, to consolidate demands and means of fulfilling them, and to consolidate methods of defending our demands and responding to all attempts at suppressing the Revolution on the part of corrupted individuals and beneficiaries of the previous regime.,Modus Operandi of the United: United members gather in and out of the square to discuss the current issues every time, and then find solutions to these issues. Then the majority’s stance is taken, and each member goes to his group to try to convince them of this solution without mentioning the United group, as if this were his personal opinion. Thanks be to God, 90% of the solutions arrived at were adopted.,The End: The United group was dismantled after the former president’s resignation speech, after which the Tahrir sit-ins ended.,,Now,,Some of the members have decided to revive the United, but publicly, by uniting all those who love Egypt without considering their political and religious affiliation, their class, or their social, financial or educational station, et cetera.,All are united under one motto: love and rebuilding the Egypt of “the United.”,This is also in order to consolidate our ideas and to counteract rumors, and to consolidate our steps so that we have one stance for reforming Egypt, overcoming crisis, and ending corruption, as well as to defend the people’s constructive demands, and combat destructive ones.,,The United’s goals are now:,1.) Reforming and building Egypt,2.) Ending corruption in Egypt from top to bottom.,3.) Combating the vandals and thugs who threaten national security,4.) Combating conspiracies.,5.) Combating deceptive rumors.,6.) Combating civil discord,7.) Enlightenment of political conduct in dialogue, discussion and acceptance of other’s opinions,8.) Raising political awareness,9.) Unification of the Egyptian people under one demand,10.) Political reform,11.) Consolidation of opinions and steps to be taken, and combating fractionalization,12.) Assisting the State in addressing this crisis on all sides, whether “economic, social, political, cultural, or security-based.”,13.) Forming public committees to protect the nation from thugs with the cooperation of honorable police officers in order to restore security to Egypt,,We urge all to disregard affiliations; your inclusion into the United does not mean you are abandoning your political orientation to another group. On the contrary, we are helping all political orientations for the better. We shall not assist any corrupt group or any group tainted with corruption, nor will we help any opinion, idea or demand unless the majority of members have agreed upon it…If you are believers in democracy, we must carry it out starting now…with ourselves.,Unity is strength and division is weakness and defeat…together until the Day of Judgment, God-willing,United we stand…divided we fall,To join:,,Telephone: ********** **********,Email: egyptian-united@live.com,Official webpage on Facebook: The Egyptian Revolution-The United,","Movements, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161020im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/TheUnited-1.png,imgID85,

We nearly forgot that the revolution isn’t over yet, since the corruption still prevails, and its symbols have not yet been tried, and the regime has not yet fallen entirely, and the blood of martyrs has not yet dried, and we all have a duty to return to the square.,Thus we call upon you oh free Egyptians, and we call on all the loyal nationalist powers and all the coalitions who speak in the name of the revolution, to prepare yourselves to unify our ranks, and we call upon you to gather today on one platform, and one message, in order to uproot corruption, and start building glories.,,Friday April 8, 2011,,1,This is a play on words and can also be read as “Not Mubarak”,","Calls to Protest, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163945im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ONE-PLATFORM-YASMEEN.png,imgID86,

Egypt of Change,2011-04-12,2011,"Egypt of Change,“Change is not just political it must be internal as well in order for us to create an advanced, civilized and truly democratic state.”,“We will change ourselves first”,,1- Morals- We must change ourselves and we must be truly united, hand in hand. We must respect the freedom of others to act as they wish. We must stop harassing women because that is not civilized behavior. Respect the freedom of women and girls walking in the street and make them feel as if they are among family. Treat all women as if they were your sister or your relative. The most important thing is that she is Egyptian like you and thus you should look out for her. Love all men and women of Egypt. We must no longer pay bribes to the parking police or at the police station and government offices. Report to the Consumer Protection Agency when you find a person selling things at exorbitant prices. Don’t be passive. Report any attack by policemen or traffic police. Also report any government department where someone is doing wrong. Truly, we must be united hand in hand as one people.,,2- Cleanliness- Pollution is the cause of a lot of illnesses therefore we must make our country clean right now. We must be united. I will ask you for things that are for your sake and for the sake of Egypt in order for us to become civilized together. I beg all Egyptian men and women to go down to the street where they live and pick up the garbage. Making your streets clean makes the streets you live in develop. Egypt will become so clean that a person will not be allowed to throw his garbage on the ground. Those who are able to buy garbage bins will put them in the street so that there is one every ten meters. If you are walking in the street and keep a small empty plastic bag with you that you can put trash in until you find a trash bin. If you are smoking cigarettes do not throw the butts on the ground. You must change yourself when it comes to cleanliness. Consider the street your home. Do you leave garbage strewn across the floor when you are home? Do you put your cigarette butts out on the ground there? Do you spit on the ground at home? Make our streets clean like our houses for the sake of Egypt and for your own sake. We want Egypt to be the most civilized and truly democratic country in the world. I beg of you keep Egypt clean.,,3- Traffic- We must respect the rules of the road and the people who cross the street regardless of whether there is an officer watching. We must stop driving so fast and we must follow the regulations of entering and exiting the metro. Be civilized for your sake and for the sake of Egypt.,,“I hope we could apply everything that is needed to make us a civilized and free country. I hope we help others. All those who are able to do something for the betterment of Egypt, do it. Let’s try to take a new step, a step towards freedom and democracy. Let’s make Egypt the best and cleanest country. Don’t leave her and then come back and say everything outside of Egypt is much cleaner. I hope those who come to Egypt are able to say that it is the cleanest and best country in the world. Don’t give anyone a chance to demean Egypt in any way. Be positive, for this is in your best interest and the best interest of Egypt.

Popular Campaign for the Rejection of Constitutional Amendments: Questions on our Minds and Occupying Our Thoughts,2011-04-08,2011,"Free Egypt- March 2011,The Popular Campaign for the Rejection of the Constitutional Amendments,Questions on our minds and occupying our thoughts.,,Q: “What does a constitution mean?”,A: The constitution is the contract between the people and the state, for in it we agree upon the rights of the people that the state must uphold.,Q: “We want the constitution so that we will be safe and secure again.”,A: The new police force is the responsibility of the Interior Minister and this is one of the institutions of the state that is under the control of ʽEsam Sharaf and has no relationship with the constitution,Q: “If we do not have a constitution then everything will stop in the country.”,A: It is the government, led by ʽEsam Sharaf (to function as a caretaker government) that is now in charge of jobs and making the country run smoothly. It’s not the constitution that’s holding things up. As we have said the constitution is a contract between the people and the state.,Q: “Ok. So why are there people telling us to say “yes” to the constitution?”,A: Because it is in the interests of these people for us to rush into elections for the People’s Assembly because they want to hold on to their positions and they want to steal our money and rob us of our rights, and if this happens the country will really stop.,Q: “So if we say no will they amend the Second Article of the constitution1?”,A: The Second Article has nothing to do with the new constitution because there will be a referendum on all the articles. As long as we want this article no one will be able to change it.,Q: “What about those who say that the new president will be the one to change the constitution?”,A: It is true that the constitutional amendments give the President the right to change the constitution, but it does not require him to draft a new constitution. There is a very big difference. Who will make sure that he makes a new constitution? Suppose the work of the movement is not up to par, what will become of our security, stability and all the wonderful things that we want for ourselves and our children?,Q: “So if we refuse the amendments will the Army stay in power?”,A: The Army does not want to rule. This is not the job of the Army and it has many other important things to do. It is the Army itself who will give up power and tend to its own matters.,Q: “I want to say yes so that we can be finished with the demonstrations.”,A: The demonstrations are for the sake of your future and my future and for the future of our children. These demonstrations were against the corrupt regime which denied us our rights and against the broken constitution which helped this regime bankrupt us. Do you think that if this broken constitution remains intact the demonstrations will stop? The demonstrations will persist unimpeded as long as the corrupt regime stands in front of your future and my future.,Q: “Won’t the President be elected, serve for a term or two and then leave?”,A: Yes the term of the President is limited but his powers are not, meaning that instead of period of 30 years of havoc in the country there will be 4 or 8 years of havoc that will followed by another 4 to 8 years and so on. It is also probable that the State Security will return…Do you want the tyranny and injustice of the State Security to return a second time and wreak havoc in the country?,,,“Yes” does not mean stability!,,The amendments will lead to more demonstrations, strikes and stopping of activity in the country.,In the words of Sheikh al-Sha’rawi: “The true revolutionary is the one who revolts to destroy corruption then calms down in order to build glory.” Therefore people are unable to calm down and to begin to build anything and be silent about corruption.,This is our first experience with free elections. If we rush into them there will be problems and we will have to start again with a new movement. We do not want another NDP.,A People’s Assembly formed through rushed elections will not represent all the groups of the Egyptian people. The people must not be silent on this fact. We do not want another NDP. We will not have time to work if we start referendums and elections.,What is built upon illegitimacy is illegitimate,The legitimacy of revolution brought down the constitution of Mubarak (Constitution of 1971),The Mubarak Constitution will bring a new dictator. Do you want a new Mubarak?,The amendments do not require the President to make a new constitution,,The People demand the amendment of Articles 76, 77, 88 and the abrogation of the Emergency Law. What else do you want?2,The people demanded the fall of the regime: the constitution is an inseparable part of the regime, especially since it was changed and amended numerous times to make the position of president a dictatorship that ruled the country without check on his power.,The Reasons for the voiding of the Constitution,The President relinquished his position: The Constitution says that the President either resigns or becomes incapacitated and unable to do his work. There is absolutely no instance in the Constitution whereby he relinquishes his position. Thus the moment the President relinquishes his authority the Constitution became void. Besides this, the Constitution makes no mention of the Army ruling the country. So the moment the Army accepted rule of the county the Constitution likewise became void.,How can I change something or fix something when it has become completely void? It has been voided by the President and the Army, it doesn’t mean that we decided out of nowhere that it’s been voided.,These amendments mean that election for the People’s Assembly and the Consultative Council (Majlis al- Shura) will be in two or three months!!!!!!!,So because we have started the process of electing the People’s Assembly and Consultative Council that represent us and speak for us, we now have time to relax and catch our breath??? The Security Forces still have not returned, the economy is at a standstill, and the people are sick and tired. How can I expect the people to ignore all of these problems, to leave their jobs, to not try to scratch out a living, in order to focus with me on elections, candidates, and campaigns? Campaigns like: this fellow is good, lets elect him but this fellow is bad and can’t speak for me. We do not want another NDP.,What are we rushing for? Is there someone running behind us that I have not noticed? I want time…For the first time, in a long time, my vote matters. I am finally able to decide my own fate.,I want time to achieve my desires, time to think, time to see, and time to participate with my vote.,By the way, refusing the constitutional amendments does not mean a return to the Constitution of 1971 but rather will be a clear message that the Egyptian People want a new constitution that represents their aspirations and defends their rights.,Many respected advisers have suggested the practical and legal solution to this problem:,Declare a temporary constitution.,Elect a president and have him form a government that represents all sides.,Create a committee for forming a new constitution.,Hold a public referendum on the new constitution.,Hold legislative elections,,,1 This is the much-debated article of the constitution that states Islamic law is the primary basis for lawmaking.,2 Article 76 details the electoral process for the president of Egypt. Article 77 sets the term of the president at six years. Article 88 lays out the requirements and regulations for the election of the (People’s Council) Majlis al- Sha’b and referendums. The Emergency law, which has been in effect nearly unabated since 1981, extends more rights to the police, legalizes censorship and allows the government to ignore constitutional rights in the name of state safety.,","Constitution, March Referendum",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130154626im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Questions-1.png,imgID92,

No to the Constitutional Amendments… No to a New Pharaoh,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 1],No to the Constitutional Amendments… No to a New Pharaoh,Hundreds of Egypt’s innocent sons and daughters died as martyrs in order to bring down the corrupt political regime, run by gangs that monopolized both power and wealth. These martyrs died for the sake of building a new political system based on justice and equality which will lead our beloved country to prosperous development.,The revolution of the Egyptian people caused the fall of the now defunct Constitution and called for a new Constitution, one which protects citizen’s rights, advances political freedoms, and creates a kind of balance between the Presidential authority, the government, the Parliament, and the judges.,The recommended constitutional amendments are unacceptable for a number of reasons, among them the fact that they do not curtail the President’s wide-ranging powers and thereby allow for the creation of a new Pharaoh to rule over us. Likewise, if parliamentary elections are held quickly, as these amendments require, the next People’s Assembly will be formed, for the most part, from the same political powers and parties of the former era—businessmen and the remnants of the National Party. And as these amendments require, they will be the ones chosen to draft a new Constitution, while it should be the right of the Egyptian people to choose a drafting committee that will write a Constitution which reflects their hopes.

Torture: A Crime Before the Revolution and After It,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 4],Torture: A Crime Before the Revolution and After It,[Picture text: No to torture in the state prisons.],We did not have the time to dream. The murder of Khalid Sa‘id and hundreds of others who were subjected to torture lit the fuse of the January 25th Revolution, which took the first of its many steps by removing the head of the regime, though it was aware from the beginning that this was not its only goal. It knew that the regime was more than Hosni Mubarak, that the regime was corruption, oppression, poverty, unemployment, discrimination between citizens on the bases of religion and gender… It was aware that the regime was open arrest warrants, blank pieces of paper signed off by officers of State Security, and hellish torture that disfigured thousands and killed hundreds… When Mubarak decided, at the end of his maneuvers—before resigning—to appoint ‘Umar Sulayman, Chief of Intelligence, as his Vice President and later give him presidential responsibilities, chants were raised along with signs refusing this most violent perpetrator of torture. He was not satisfied merely to torture Egyptians, but also initiated prisoner exchange with the American administration and some European countries. They began exporting victims to him for torture, given his intimate knowledge of the intelligence and State Security apparatuses.,Before we could demand that those responsible for torture before the 25th of January be held responsible, open the sealed files in the Attorney General’s office, and attempt to categorize and pay reparations to its victims and the families of those killed by torture, we saw a new segment of Egyptians—youths and adults, men and women—subjected to heinous types of torture, leaving whip lashes and electric burns on their bodies, even days after release in some cases. This time, torture was not inflicted by the police, but by army men and the military police: the Egyptian Museum was turned into a prison for the Tahrir revolutionaries, and young men and women were subjected to beating, whipping, and electric prodding before being released or sent to military prisons, where the crimes are repeated in a more brutal manner and with utter disregard for human dignity.,The Egyptian people did not revolt in order to swap one executioner for another, nor did they do so to swap the State Security headquarters and police stations with military prisons. They were not and are not in need of State Security courts being substituted with military ones. They revolted in order to hold accountable those executioners who ruled the country with iron and fire, who stole young adulthood from the youths, and feelings of dignity, security, and hope for a better tomorrow from the Egyptians.,Today, reflecting on the operations to storm the State Security Headquarters, and after listening to yet another witness and seeing yet another picture, you can see how much torture was inflicted by the military in the Egyptian Museum and military prisons. This confirms our fear that most of what goes on in these headquarters has been intentionally destroyed and burned. Nothing is left except a few papers, which they want us to become preoccupied with circulating. In these headquarters, we did not find anyone imprisoned, though we know that thousands are still in chains. We did not find State Security officers, though we found pictures of them. We did not see even one of them brought to justice to account for the crimes he committed. Today, we open a new file for torture, pointing the accusatory finger towards the army’s men. After facing the army’s whips and billy clubs, the victims of torture leave wounded, with gouges in their bodies and strong feelings of anger and humiliation in their souls. While a wounded body is sure to heal as its injuries fade away with time, it is not so for a wounded soul, where memories do not fade away—especially since the victims this time were January 25th revolutionaries. Pictures of the martyrs and the wounded remain before their eyes, and the joy of February 11th, when they saw the sign of victory, remains in their hearts. Many of them still do not want to believe that the hand grasping the whip was that of the military, for whom the people cheered less than two months ago.,The developments over the following days and weeks have proved that the people are the only true guarantee for the revolution’s victory, that the path to victory is long, and that we are still at the beginning.,Torture before January 25th did not end with the passage of time, nor will torture after January 25th. The difference is that anyone who inflicts torture after the 25th of January has the memory of the revolution, and the memory of the revolution does not forget those who joined in solidarity, just as it does not forget those who were disloyal. It knows how to hold someone accountable, even after a time.,","Military, Regime, Security Forces",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155713im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID96,
The Revolution and Revolution in the Arab Region,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 3],The Revolution and Revolution in the Arab Region,Did the United States suddenly recall that Qaddafi’s regime oppressed protestors? It moved its fleet close to Libya’s shores while the European Union announced the no-fly zone. All that occurred without any real steps to stop the massacres that Qaddafi was committing against his people, just as there was no movement throughout the years of his despotic rule.,The secret word is fear… Fear for oil riches and for popular revolution. The United States was supporting and welcoming dictatorial regimes as long as their loyalty was guaranteed. However, now it is trembling, scared of popular revolutions that aim to be rid of the dictator’s grasp, the exploitation of worldwide monopolies, and subjection to the dictates of colonialism.,The American forces marched to control the situation. If Qaddafi falls, the US will have to guarantee a stable situation, which will allow it to pump Libyan oil. The US is not interested in how many victims fall as long as Qaddafi falls, just as it was not interested in how many victims Mubarak felled in order to protect his throne.,On the other hand, Saudi forces entered Bahraini territory, under the name of “Peninsula Shield Forces”. The first batch of them was made up of 150 armored troop carriers and almost 50 military boats, while eye witnesses mentioned that there were tanks among them. These forces entered at the request of the Bahraini king and with America’s blessing. That came after the Bahraini Workers’ Unions announced a general strike, responded to across the country. At the time, official media—not limited to Bahrain—claimed that is was a sectarian issue, with Shi‘is being agitated by incitement from Iran and Hizbullah. They did not mention that it was a matter of a majority suffering from the rule of the minority, trying to change the population distribution.,The king who made his country into something like a special American base at the entrance of the Gulf is sheltered by Saudi overlords from peaceful revolutions demanding democratic rights which do not affect his throne. The Saudis oppressed the protesters with gunfire and had previously swept through Yemeni lands pursuing the Huthis.,The picture is clear. The interests of Arab regimes are interrelated and associated with American—Zionist colonialism. They are clearly hostile to their working classes and prepared to sacrifice the last drop of blood of the last citizen when faced with protecting their thrones. Is it not rational to note that the lives of revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Yemen are all dependent on each other and dependent on the spread of revolution among the rest of the Arab peoples?,","Revolution, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164004im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID97,
Disband the Local Popular Councils Right Now,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 3],Disband the Local Popular Councils Right Now,Among the most powerful remnants of the deposed regime in Egypt are the “Local Popular Councils”, for, as it is said, if the amount of fraudulent votes in the parliamentary elections was 90%, then this number certainly reaches 100% in the Local Councils. This is especially after the enactment of the corrupt constitutional amendments in 2006 which stipulated acquiring majority support from the Local Popular Councils in order to run in the presidential elections.,The January 25th Revolution has brought this regime down along with all that represented it. It does not make sense to make the decision to disband that People’s Assembly and the Shura Council and not apply the same to the Local Councils—for they are more dangerous. They are made up of 52 thousand members across the Republic, and all but 2% are in the National Party. They were where the parliamentary leadership and corrupt politicians had their dumping ground.,The Local Councils crisis is not only attached to their performance and existence as a direct branch of the National Party within every village and city but also to their mandated role of enforcing the current Constitution and what comes from it in terms of laws. Law number 43 of the Local Administration from 1989 states that the Local Councils have a role in supervising different facilities and workers who enter into the governorate’s jurisdiction along with supervision of the implementation of particular plans for local development, following them up, deciding the economic and social development plan, drawing up the yearly budget for the governorate, and following up with its implementation. Additionally, they suggest plans for urban construction and development and approve what facilities, which return profit to the governorate, want. They suggest general regulations for organizing how a governorate’s agencies work with the Republic.,We consider them “illusory functions” in the shadow of a Constitution that does not raise the value of local rule and does not support decentralization. Thus, the demand for disbanding the Local Councils is without a doubt connected to creating a new Constitution that represents a legitimacy created by the Egyptian people’s revolution in order to achieve their hopes. In this way, there will be a role for every individual in determining the plans of his city and the quality of its development, obtaining his rights in full within it. That will not happen except with a complete change doing away with the idea of a single individual and central institutions.,Perhaps the idea of “Popular Committees”—produced during the first days of the revolution for the administration of security within each region and which spontaneously developed after that in the formation of discussion groups and broad interaction among citizens regarding the possibility of developing their governorate’s resources and administering their daily affairs—is an affirmation of the necessity of working to create real popular organizations. Their aim would be the service of the people, not the service of the regime or a corrupt party or individual.,","Politics, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162254im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID98,
The Students of Egypt are Affirming… The Revolution Continues,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 3],The Students of Egypt are Affirming… The Revolution Continues,Under the siege and blockade of the administrations of Mubarak’s regime, which were imposed on our universities and still govern them today—having transformed them into prisons of desolation with no knowledge or freedom in them—the intifada of Egypt’s students has reached its second week in a row. They are demanding the removal and trial of the heads of corruption in their universities, represented by presidents, university security, deans, agencies, college trustees, and their deputies. They also demand the fall of corrupt administration structures, which were appointed by way of Mubarak’s State Security investigations. They demand replacing them with interim impartial administrative councils made up of members of independent teaching agencies not tied to the failed regime. These councils should oversee the repeal of the appointment system which the Mubarak regime set up to choose university administrations. They should also put in place new rules and regulations to organize a free election process among the members of the teaching agencies of each university to choose an elected administration subjected to oversight and held accountable for its mistakes.,The revolutionaries in the universities also demand fair and transparent elections, without restrictions or abuse, for student unions, the implementation of free education, support for university books, and the fall of regulation 2007. They demand a return to working by regulation 76 until the completion of a number of new regulations with the students’ participation. Additionally, they demand the freedom to hold seminars, organize activities within the university, the right to form student groups by giving notice only, reorganizing enrollment procedures, permitting students who entered open education directly from high school following its repeal to relocate to it should they so desire, and founding male and female open education student unions.,[Picture text: A free university, oh my country.],Egyptian university students have struggled for years to get hold of these demands and others. The magnificent revolution in which they participated inspired them, individually at first. Then they came together through it as free students, sitting-in and protesting since the first day of the return of studies. This exists in the framework of completing the revolution’s mission to liberate the universities, cleanse them, and take back their independence from the control of the symbols of Mubarak’s fallen regime.,In Cairo University, the students’ sit-ins have reached inside their colleges’ buildings and in front of the administration building (the Dome) since day one of studies this term. At the time in which they were demanding the fall of the university’s president and its administrative structure, they maintained the continuance of the education process, until even now. This happened in the face of university president Hussam Kamil’s calls for the suspension of classes in the university. Since the students’ sit-in alarmed him, he decided not to be present at the university throughout the two past weeks. The students and honest professors faced these proceedings with the utmost resoluteness and insisted on the resumption of classes. Lectures were organized in most of the colleges before the Minister of Education released an announcement that university classes would not be suspended. The students insist on replacing university administration staff that symbolize the previous regime with others who are acceptable to the students and professors. Their giving up their functions and positions immediately opens a door for serious discussion about the demands of each separate college.,It remains to say that the University of Cairo’s revolutionary students are part of a larger movement which has arisen in most of Egypt’s universities to purify them of the symbols of Mubarak, such as the students of the following universities (and not only these): Hulwan, ‘Ayn Shams, Asyut, al-Mansura, and Alexandria.,Egypt’s students have taken on their shoulders the mission of purifying the country and completing the revolution with the fall of the defunct regime’s symbols in their universities. They face the horns of the counter-revolution, calling for stability and patience for the corrupt accomplices who tarnished the universities and imprisoned them throughout the past decades, until the end of the semester. However, we will not be patient for the corrupt after today. Egypt’s students are in need of the support of every revolutionary and honest person, so support them.,",Solidarity,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164826im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID99,
Military Tribunals for the Revolutionaries and Civil Tribunals for the Murderers and the Corrupt,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 3],Military Tribunals for the Revolutionaries and Civil Tribunals for the Murderers and the Corrupt,When military policemen brutally broke up the sit-in at Tahrir on Friday, February 25th, it was reminiscent of the police confrontations on the 25th of January. The Military Council spokesman came out strongly apologizing, assuring that what happened was a solitary mistake of some officers of the military police, although one activist, ‘Amr al-Bahiri, was put on trial in military court accused of resisting the army—while unarmed. After three days, he was sentenced to a five-year prison term.,Complacency about what happened was the principle reason that the matter repeated in a more brutal and fierce way on March 8th and 9th. It began with the vile harassment of activists under the watch of soldiers while they celebrated International Woman’s Day. Then on the next day, following friction between thugs and people sitting-in, the violent army intervened to break up the sit-in and arrest several activists, lock them up in the Egyptian Museum, torture them, and electrocute them in a horrific manner that is none less than the crimes of the State Security. They then transferred some of the prisoners to military tribunals.,A group of rights and legal centers has published an announcement condemning what happened and calling on the army to investigate and apologize for it.,It is unacceptable that citizens are being subjected to military tribunals instead of being tried by their normal judges while killers like Habib al-‘Adili and his comrades—and likewise the corrupt like Ahmad ‘Izz and his compatriots—are being tried before civil courts. They are provided with every opportunity for defense, their cells are guarded, and they are permitted visits from family and lawyers.,We demand that the unjust military tribunals stop, that their provisions be repealed, that all political prisoners be released, that all trials occur in civil courts, and that the army officers involved in crimes of torture be held accountable.

"To ‘Isam Sharaf:  Say Social Rights, Do not Say Sectarian Demands",2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 2],To ‘Isam Sharaf: Say Social Rights, Do not Say Sectarian Demands,‘Isam Sharaf, the Prime Minister, who announced that he derives his legitimacy from the revolution, surprised us when he launched a severe attack against social and worker’s rights demonstrators which continued after his appointment to the position. He described them as sectarian demonstrations that represented a disgrace to the revolution, using the same description that comrade Shafiq had previously used.,Some of these demonstrations were demanding the fixation [i.e., making permanent] of temporary workers, or combining years of service, and the return of seasonal workers. These were rights that had been demanded, before, during, and after the revolution and it is now necessary to lay down a timetable for realizing them.,The largest part of the demonstrations came to complete the revolutions’ missions to achieve popular supervision, freedom, and social justice, such as:,[Text in the photo reads: “Victory to the Workers”],*Pursuing symbols of corruption in different factories, companies, and agencies, like the head of Ghazl al-Mahalla Company who fired workers.,*Raising the minimum wage and looking into the maximum wage of a number of consultants whose services were accrued with astronomical sums in the large majority of agencies, ministries, and banks with farcical contracts made out to Aunt whom-ever and Uncle so-and-so.,*Being free to form independent unions and labor unions.,So, it was expected that the Prime Minister would invigorate the demonstrating workers as their revolution continued. Completion of the revolution’s tasks include the fall of every little Mubarak in every workplace rather than turning the masses against each other by using the expression “sectarian demands” and throwing out accusations of selfishness with regards to their legitimate struggle.,Does he remember that the revolution almost did not succeed, were it not for the consecutive knockout punches delivered by the transportation workers’ strikes, Suez, al-Mahalla, Hulwan, and the civil disobedience in all areas of Egypt before the collapse of the regime? It is thanks to these demonstrations that the revolution succeeded.,On the other hand, the strange thing is the suspicious pampering of the police who have refused to return to the streets until now. Their incentives have been raised by 100% despite the fact that some of them are lackeys of the counter-revolution. Is this not the ugliest example of counter-revolutionary groups?,This is the disgrace Dr. ‘Isam, not the social demonstrations.,","Regime, Religion, Sectarian Strife, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160432im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID101,
Democracy has Two Faces… Which One do We Want?,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 2],Democracy has Two Faces… Which One do We Want?,For many years, the Egyptian people suffered from an absence of democracy, which remained a dream that the aspirations of Egypt’s loyal sons merely flirted with. They offered huge sacrifices in pursuit of realizing this dream in the shadow of an oppressive and despotic regime that did not hesitate to arrest, torture, and kill political activists.,Today, democracy is no longer merely a dream, but rather a goal achieved in reality, thanks to the glorious Egyptian revolution. Millions of Egyptians participated in it with the goal of building a new society, which is founded on justice and dignity, saves the majority of Egyptians from extreme poverty, and ends the monopoly by a handful of businessmen and elite men of state over riches and power. The Egyptians revolted in the face of a corrupt political order which granted elite businessmen huge economic privileges while at the same time the state abandoned its responsibilities to its citizens: healthcare, education, housing, and employment.,[The central cartoon depicts a giant hand planting a tree in the center of Tahrir Square. On its roots the word “Democracy” is written.],Now the question is: what are the qualities of a democratic system which is able to achieve the goals and aspirations of the revolutionaries as far as social justice, dignity, and humanity?,Perhaps some might answer: we do not need to reinvent the wheel since it is possible to model it on the experiences of developed countries that already have democratic systems and are able to achieve high standards of living for the majority of their population. Also, democracy is manifested in fair elections, untainted by fraud, which give every political current opportunity and independence to present their programs to the voters so that they may choose who will represent them in the elected councils (parliament) for several years. These representatives undertake a supervisory role over state institutions and likewise drafting legislation and laws. They should reflect the interests of voters. It is the same with the unions, where elections are held for the workers’ representatives who negotiate with businessmen or the state to protect workers’ rights.,According to this perception, democracy becomes a tool that can reduce occurrences of corruption and exploitation of positions for illegal earnings. That democracy has succeeded to limit some phenomena such as poverty and unemployment by creating more just social policies when real representatives from the working class have access to elected bodies.,Unfortunately, democracy does not reach parliament, even in developed European countries, most of the time because the candidates are made up of the wealthy or those supported by big business. Therefore, it is not strange that these parliaments put in place legislation and policies against the interests of the poor. This was powerfully clear during the recent world economic crisis, in which the poor paid the price to save the businessmen. Workers in those countries did not find that the elected bodies were able to defend their rights, so they resorted to protests, sit-ins, strikes, and civil disobedience as well as popular intifadas that put pressure on the governing elite to defend the minimum limit for a dignified life.,There is a truth which the experiences of nations have affirmed: the laws and legislation of any society are an expression of the balance of social power within them. This means that the powerful impose their laws on the weak. For instance, in Egypt, where the prevailing power during the Mubarak era was made up of a handful of businessmen and some elite men of state, laws came as an expression of their interests. However, the events of the Egyptian revolution upset the balance of power within society. The ability of mobilized masses to overthrow the symbols of corruption became clear. Still, there is a fear of the response, a return to the status quo, and to the balance of power as it was, especially in the shadow of stopping the momentum of the mobilized masses, thanks to propaganda calling for a stop to strikes, sit-ins, and protests, on the pretense of the interests of the country. The true intention of undertaking these calls is stopping the revolution at a stage excluding the symbols of the regime, while maintaining and preserving the regime itself with its laws, opportunistic policies for businessmen, and cooperation with colonizing powers.,Democracy without social justice has no meaning; it is merely form without content. We must defend another type of democracy, one which is able to express and defend the interests of the working-class majority comprised of the sons of the nation. With that, it is possible to achieve the hopes of the Egyptians for a society based on justice and dignity without oppression, poverty, or unemployment. But how can we achieve the type of democracy that has these social guarantees?,This is the difficult question. We will not find an easy answer in political science books, but the actual answer will come from the womb of the Egyptian revolution in its continuation and success in changing Egyptians’ circumstances.,The workers’ struggle to form real unions to defend their rights, removed from the union bureaucracy and state authority, or the students’ struggle within the universities to form student unions in order to defend free, high-quality education, and other types of regulatory democratic institutions, will help to build a democratic political order based on social justice.,",Politics,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161129im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID102,

Patience is the Key to the Counter-Revolution,2011-04-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 4, Page 1],Patience is the Key to the Counter-Revolution,The Egyptian people’s revolution succeeded in creating a gaping hole in the wall of the regime that governed us for the past thirty years. However, this wall has not yet been completely torn down. Its columns remain standing in the governorates, security departments, local councils, the National Party, the emergency law, and the state security apparatus. The corruption and despotism which destroyed political and social life in Egypt were manifested in these and many other government agencies. And now that our revolution has started creating the change of which the Egyptian people dreamed, there are those who ask us to be patient, to give them an opportunity to fulfill demands, and to stop protesting, sit-ins, and strikes in order to protect “security,” “stability,” and “the economy.” They call for this as if the revolution had finished, as if the demands made by the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square and Egypt’s other squares had been met.,We say to any who asks us to be patient:,The Egyptian people were patient for thirty years, throughout which they were fed humiliation and shame by the regime of Mubarak, whose symbols are still enjoying their freedom. For example, Safwat al-Sharif, Fathi Surur, and Zakaria ‘Azmi are striving with all their power to abort our revolution and intercept it by igniting sectarian strife. Tantawi, “Mubarak’s Right-Hand Man,” still heads the Military Council and controls the prisons. Patience for these people means handing the revolution over to them on a silver platter so they can terminate it. These people, and others like them, worked with Mubarak to oppress the Egyptian people and abuse their dignity by shaming them. They fulfilled their greed by stealing the Egyptian people’s riches and divvying them up between Mubarak and other members of his family. Shall we let them steal our right to be free from the shackles with which they chained us for all these years?,Being patient with these people means the rest of our demands will not be met. Those demands that were realized were achieved through millions of people descending into the streets to insist on them. Those that remain will only be achieved if we go out into the streets once more. This is what the eighteen-day experience, led by Egyptian revolutionaries in the streets, has taught us: freedoms and rights are not granted; they are grabbed by force. Otherwise, the counter-revolution will grow and spread until we find ourselves back under the old regime, organizing itself once again to rebuild what existed before the 25th of January, if not something worse. It is up to us, the Egyptian revolutionaries, to be on the lookout for Mubarak’s snakes who are still hidden under their rocks. It is up to us to insist on achieving all of the revolution’s demands immediately and without delay. Being patient for these people is the key to the success of the counter-revolution which they are now undertaking.,[The photo depicts a young man flying an Egyptian flag of which an eagle flies in front.

The people were not deceived by Mubarak’s plan to derail the goal of the revolution by appointing Dr. Shafiq as Prime Minister and General Sulayman as Vice President .,They did not stop when Mubarak himself left power or when some of the symbols of the regime were presented for trial with the charge of financial corruption. Not one of these—nor others who practiced political corruption, set up authoritarianism, impoverished citizens, and stole the economy—has been tried with these charges, despite the existence of counter-revolutionary elements who are trying to abort the goals of the revolution. Any citizen knows who they are, be they individuals, remnants of institutions, or even corrupt ideas and laws.,What is surprising to the sons of our nation is that imposing a protest law is not merely against the principles of the revolution. Instead, it opens the way for its abortion, due to its integration with the party law that requires the founders of any new party to own millions in order to be able to spend nearly 4 million pounds on publicizing the founders’ names. The only way to make sense of this law is that it excludes more than 60% of Egypt’s people. It keeps the the right of participating in the establishment of a party from the youth, who have this right, along with poor workers, peasants, small-time professionals and merchants.,,We raised the slogan “the people want the fall of the regime” and to this day it remains mostly unachieved.

Cry of the People,2011-04-04,2011,",Mr. al-Mashir and the Supreme Leader of the Armed Forces,,Warm greetings….Children of the Nation ! Children of the just and honorable revolution! Children of the January 25th Revolution!,Egypt is truly safe in your hands, and the January 25th Revolution—the Martyrs’ Revolution— the Revolution of Right and Honor—has not yet come to an end. It will never end, so long as the roots of corruption have not been weeded out and the supporters of the heathen party1 remain on Egyptian soil. The just and honorable revolution will not end so long as the roots of the corrupt regime and its supporters are spread throughout Egypt—the great Egyptian people’s revolution will not end so long as the companions of the tyrant dream of returning once again in an attempt to abort your glorious revolution.,Therefore we demand the fulfillment of the great revolution’s hopes.,First : – Weeding out the roots of tyranny by dissolving the National Democratic Party, ending its operations once and for all, restoring its offices to the state, and forbidding its members from engaging in political life at all.,Second : – Digging up the seeds of corruption from Egyptian soil by dissolving the local councils and ending their operations so that their funds will return to the state.,Third : – Confiscating all stolen land and returning it to the state.,Fourth : – Making social justice a reality while combating poverty, ignorance, and disease.,From the masses of the Egyptian people.,1A play on words. al-Hizb al-Watani refers to “the National Democratic Party;” what is written in Arabic reads al-Hizb al-Wathani, meaning the party of idolatry or paganism.,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162149im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CriesOfThePeople.png,imgID108,
Communist Party: No to Implementing the Constitution of the Corrupt,2011-04-04,2011,",,The Communist Party of Egypt would like to confirm the position it previously announced regarding the constitutional amendments, according to which the party rejected the constitutional amendments and demanded a new constitution, refusing any attempts to patch up the tyrannical constitution of 1971 that was overthrown by the law of the 25 January Revolution. We are confident that this great people yearning for freedom and change will not let its sacrifices and the blood of its martyrs go to waste without any real change.,The party will continue its struggle among the people’s ranks for the sake of a new constitution that institutes a civil, democratic, parliamentary system and a state of law and social justice for every citizen.,And in accordance with the rights of the Egyptian people who undertook this great revolution against the corrupt and autocratic regime, the Party will vote “no” on the constitutional revisions and demand a new constitution that protects the people’s rights and brings the demands of its great revolution to fruition.,Glory to the Martyrs…Freedom for the People,The Egyptian Communist Party,March 18th, 2011,,———–,,To get in touch with the party: our website: http://egyptian.wordpress.com email: [redacted]","Constitution, March Referendum, Politics, The Egyptian Communist Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152106im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/whynotoaconstitutionofthecorrupt.png,imgID109,
"Revolutionary Egypt, Volume 4 (4 pages)",2011-04-04,2011,"Page 1,Logo: “The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution”,Revolutionary Egypt,A progressive publication issued by the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.,4th Edition, 3rd Week of March, 2011,No to the Constitutional Amendments… No to a New Pharaoh,Hundreds of Egypt’s innocent sons and daughters died as martyrs in order to bring down the corrupt political regime, run by gangs that monopolized both power and wealth. These martyrs died for the sake of building a new political system based on justice and equality which will lead our beloved country to prosperous development.,The revolution of the Egyptian people caused the fall of the now defunct Constitution and called for a new Constitution, one which protects citizen’s rights, advances political freedoms, and creates a kind of balance between the Presidential authority, the government, the Parliament, and the judges.,The recommended constitutional amendments are unacceptable for a number of reasons, among them the fact that they do not curtail the President’s wide-ranging powers and thereby allow for the creation of a new Pharaoh to rule over us. Likewise, if parliamentary elections are held quickly, as these amendments require, the next People’s Assembly will be formed, for the most part, from the same political powers and parties of the former era—businessmen and the remnants of the National Party. And as these amendments require, they will be the ones chosen to draft a new Constitution, while it should be the right of the Egyptian people to choose a drafting committee that will write a Constitution which reflects their hopes. The Constitution should not protect the interests of politicians or businessmen.,Let us take the alternative path, upon which most political powers agree.,-The formation of a temporary civilian Presidential committee to manage the transitional phase, to exist for one year, while the army returns to its barracks.,-Creating a temporary constitutional proclamation including general constitutional principles.,-Electing a drafting committee to formulate a new Constitution.,-Granting political freedoms: the freedom to create political parties and unions, and the freedom of political campaigning, which will permit citizens to become familiar with the parties as well as their different political affiliations and programs, providing for the election of real representatives of the people in parliamentary and local councils.,-Holding presidential and parliamentary elections that conform to the new Constitution.,Let us all move together to vote against the constitutional amendments so that we can create a new Constitution for the country which brings the hopes of the Egyptian people to fruition.,[Photo text: Logo—“The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution”—No to the constitutional amendments, the people want a new Constitution.],,Patience is the Key to the Counter-Revolution,The Egyptian people’s revolution succeeded in creating a gaping hole in the wall of the regime that governed us for the past thirty years. However, this wall has not yet been completely torn down. Its columns remain standing in the governorates, security departments, local councils, the National Party, the emergency law, and the state security apparatus. The corruption and despotism which destroyed political and social life in Egypt were manifested in these and many other government agencies. And now that our revolution has started creating the change of which the Egyptian people dreamed, there are those who ask us to be patient, to give them an opportunity to fulfill demands, and to stop protesting, sit-ins, and strikes in order to protect “security,” “stability,” and “the economy.” They call for this as if the revolution had finished, as if the demands made by the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square and Egypt’s other squares had been met.,We say to any who asks us to be patient:,The Egyptian people were patient for thirty years, throughout which they were fed humiliation and shame by the regime of Mubarak, whose symbols are still enjoying their freedom. For example, Safwat al-Sharif, Fathi Surur, and Zakaria ‘Azmi are striving with all their power to abort our revolution and intercept it by igniting sectarian strife. Tantawi, “Mubarak’s Right-Hand Man,” still heads the Military Council and controls the prisons. Patience for these people means handing the revolution over to them on a silver platter so they can terminate it. These people, and others like them, worked with Mubarak to oppress the Egyptian people and abuse their dignity by shaming them. They fulfilled their greed by stealing the Egyptian people’s riches and divvying them up between Mubarak and other members of his family. Shall we let them steal our right to be free from the shackles with which they chained us for all these years?,Being patient with these people means the rest of our demands will not be met. Those demands that were realized were achieved through millions of people descending into the streets to insist on them. Those that remain will only be achieved if we go out into the streets once more. This is what the eighteen-day experience, led by Egyptian revolutionaries in the streets, has taught us: freedoms and rights are not granted; they are grabbed by force. Otherwise, the counter-revolution will grow and spread until we find ourselves back under the old regime, organizing itself once again to rebuild what existed before the 25th of January, if not something worse. It is up to us, the Egyptian revolutionaries, to be on the lookout for Mubarak’s snakes who are still hidden under their rocks. It is up to us to insist on achieving all of the revolution’s demands immediately and without delay. Being patient for these people is the key to the success of the counter-revolution which they are now undertaking.,[The photo depicts a young man flying an Egyptian flag of which an eagle flies in front. The text reads, ""Oh heart of Egypt and its pulse. Oh son of the country.""],Page 2,Right Column: “Revolutionary Egypt”,Initiatives,Progressive Youth Association of the Revolution,(Name repeated in logo),This is an initiative of a group of youths to create an association founded on the following general principles derived from the spirit of the revolution.,1- Ensuring a civil state and balance among citizens as far as rights and duties, regardless of religion, belief, sex, color, or race.,2- Broadening and deepening democratic practices.,3- Activating popular participation in drafting state policies and monitoring them and the various state apparatuses to guarantee the protection of peoples’ rights and the gains of the revolution.,4- Social justice and guaranteeing a basic level of dignity for every Egyptian in their lives.,5- Respecting and completely releasing freedoms and human rights, foremost the freedom of expression and the right to organize.,6- Ensuring the independence of national decisions.,Agreement has been reached on a number of mechanisms to work towards this:,1- The formation of a lobby group to guarantee adherence to the previously mentioned principles.,2- Activating coordination and sincere cooperation among all the loyal national powers, especially the democratic youth initiatives which set off the 25 January Revolution.,3- Aiding in the political consciousness of the public, especially the youths, with a focus on widening the democratic arena, political activity, and popular participation.,4- Starting up several various initiatives to contribute to the enrichment and organization of revolutionary work.,Contact: apyr@googlegroups.com,,Democracy has Two Faces… Which One do We Want?,For many years, the Egyptian people suffered from an absence of democracy, which remained a dream that the aspirations of Egypt’s loyal sons merely flirted with. They offered huge sacrifices in pursuit of realizing this dream in the shadow of an oppressive and despotic regime that did not hesitate to arrest, torture, and kill political activists.,Today, democracy is no longer merely a dream, but rather a goal achieved in reality, thanks to the glorious Egyptian revolution. Millions of Egyptians participated in it with the goal of building a new society, which is founded on justice and dignity, saves the majority of Egyptians from extreme poverty, and ends the monopoly by a handful of businessmen and elite men of state over riches and power. The Egyptians revolted in the face of a corrupt political order which granted elite businessmen huge economic privileges while at the same time the state abandoned its responsibilities to its citizens: healthcare, education, housing, and employment.,[The central cartoon depicts a giant hand planting a tree in the center of Tahrir Square. On its roots the word “Democracy” is written.],Now the question is: what are the qualities of a democratic system which is able to achieve the goals and aspirations of the revolutionaries as far as social justice, dignity, and humanity?,Perhaps some might answer: we do not need to reinvent the wheel since it is possible to model it on the experiences of developed countries that already have democratic systems and are able to achieve high standards of living for the majority of their population. Also, democracy is manifested in fair elections, untainted by fraud, which give every political current opportunity and independence to present their programs to the voters so that they may choose who will represent them in the elected councils (parliament) for several years. These representatives undertake a supervisory role over state institutions and likewise drafting legislation and laws. They should reflect the interests of voters. It is the same with the unions, where elections are held for the workers’ representatives who negotiate with businessmen or the state to protect workers’ rights.,According to this perception, democracy becomes a tool that can reduce occurrences of corruption and exploitation of positions for illegal earnings. That democracy has succeeded to limit some phenomena such as poverty and unemployment by creating more just social policies when real representatives from the working class have access to elected bodies.,Unfortunately, democracy does not reach parliament, even in developed European countries, most of the time because the candidates are made up of the wealthy or those supported by big business. Therefore, it is not strange that these parliaments put in place legislation and policies against the interests of the poor. This was powerfully clear during the recent world economic crisis, in which the poor paid the price to save the businessmen. Workers in those countries did not find that the elected bodies were able to defend their rights, so they resorted to protests, sit-ins, strikes, and civil disobedience as well as popular intifadas that put pressure on the governing elite to defend the minimum limit for a dignified life.,There is a truth which the experiences of nations have affirmed: the laws and legislation of any society are an expression of the balance of social power within them. This means that the powerful impose their laws on the weak. For instance, in Egypt, where the prevailing power during the Mubarak era was made up of a handful of businessmen and some elite men of state, laws came as an expression of their interests. However, the events of the Egyptian revolution upset the balance of power within society. The ability of mobilized masses to overthrow the symbols of corruption became clear. Still, there is a fear of the response, a return to the status quo, and to the balance of power as it was, especially in the shadow of stopping the momentum of the mobilized masses, thanks to propaganda calling for a stop to strikes, sit-ins, and protests, on the pretense of the interests of the country. The true intention of undertaking these calls is stopping the revolution at a stage excluding the symbols of the regime, while maintaining and preserving the regime itself with its laws, opportunistic policies for businessmen, and cooperation with colonizing powers.,Democracy without social justice has no meaning; it is merely form without content. We must defend another type of democracy, one which is able to express and defend the interests of the working-class majority comprised of the sons of the nation. With that, it is possible to achieve the hopes of the Egyptians for a society based on justice and dignity without oppression, poverty, or unemployment. But how can we achieve the type of democracy that has these social guarantees?,This is the difficult question. We will not find an easy answer in political science books, but the actual answer will come from the womb of the Egyptian revolution in its continuation and success in changing Egyptians’ circumstances.,The workers’ struggle to form real unions to defend their rights, removed from the union bureaucracy and state authority, or the students’ struggle within the universities to form student unions in order to defend free, high-quality education, and other types of regulatory democratic institutions, will help to build a democratic political order based on social justice.,,,,,,,,,To ‘Isam Sharaf: Say Social Rights, Do not Say Sectarian Demands,‘Isam Sharaf, the Prime Minister, who announced that he derives his legitimacy from the revolution, surprised us when he launched a severe attack against social and worker’s rights demonstrators which continued after his appointment to the position. He described them as sectarian demonstrations that represented a disgrace to the revolution, using the same description that comrade Shafiq had previously used.,Some of these demonstrations were demanding the fixation [i.e., making permanent] of temporary workers, or combining years of service, and the return of seasonal workers. These were rights that had been demanded, before, during, and after the revolution and it is now necessary to lay down a timetable for realizing them.,The largest part of the demonstrations came to complete the revolutions’ missions to achieve popular supervision, freedom, and social justice, such as:,[Text in the photo reads: “Victory to the Workers”],*Pursuing symbols of corruption in different factories, companies, and agencies, like the head of Ghazl al-Mahalla Company who fired workers.,*Raising the minimum wage and looking into the maximum wage of a number of consultants whose services were accrued with astronomical sums in the large majority of agencies, ministries, and banks with farcical contracts made out to Aunt whom-ever and Uncle so-and-so.,*Being free to form independent unions and labor unions.,So, it was expected that the Prime Minister would invigorate the demonstrating workers as their revolution continued. Completion of the revolution’s tasks include the fall of every little Mubarak in every workplace rather than turning the masses against each other by using the expression “sectarian demands” and throwing out accusations of selfishness with regards to their legitimate struggle.,Does he remember that the revolution almost did not succeed, were it not for the consecutive knockout punches delivered by the transportation workers’ strikes, Suez, al-Mahalla, Hulwan, and the civil disobedience in all areas of Egypt before the collapse of the regime? It is thanks to these demonstrations that the revolution succeeded.,On the other hand, the strange thing is the suspicious pampering of the police who have refused to return to the streets until now. Their incentives have been raised by 100% despite the fact that some of them are lackeys of the counter-revolution. Is this not the ugliest example of counter-revolutionary groups?,This is the disgrace Dr. ‘Isam, not the social demonstrations.,,Page 3,Military Tribunals for the Revolutionaries and Civil Tribunals for the Murderers and the Corrupt,When military policemen brutally broke up the sit-in at Tahrir on Friday, February 25th, it was reminiscent of the police confrontations on the 25th of January. The Military Council spokesman came out strongly apologizing, assuring that what happened was a solitary mistake of some officers of the military police, although one activist, ‘Amr al-Bahiri, was put on trial in military court accused of resisting the army—while unarmed. After three days, he was sentenced to a five-year prison term.,Complacency about what happened was the principle reason that the matter repeated in a more brutal and fierce way on March 8th and 9th. It began with the vile harassment of activists under the watch of soldiers while they celebrated International Woman’s Day. Then on the next day, following friction between thugs and people sitting-in, the violent army intervened to break up the sit-in and arrest several activists, lock them up in the Egyptian Museum, torture them, and electrocute them in a horrific manner that is none less than the crimes of the State Security. They then transferred some of the prisoners to military tribunals.,A group of rights and legal centers has published an announcement condemning what happened and calling on the army to investigate and apologize for it.,It is unacceptable that citizens are being subjected to military tribunals instead of being tried by their normal judges while killers like Habib al-‘Adili and his comrades—and likewise the corrupt like Ahmad ‘Izz and his compatriots—are being tried before civil courts. They are provided with every opportunity for defense, their cells are guarded, and they are permitted visits from family and lawyers.,We demand that the unjust military tribunals stop, that their provisions be repealed, that all political prisoners be released, that all trials occur in civil courts, and that the army officers involved in crimes of torture be held accountable. Sit-ins, protests, and strikes from work are rights for citizens, and it is impermissible to infringe on any of them.,,,The Students of Egypt are Affirming… The Revolution Continues,Under the siege and blockade of the administrations of Mubarak’s regime, which were imposed on our universities and still govern them today—having transformed them into prisons of desolation with no knowledge or freedom in them—the intifada of Egypt’s students has reached its second week in a row. They are demanding the removal and trial of the heads of corruption in their universities, represented by presidents, university security, deans, agencies, college trustees, and their deputies. They also demand the fall of corrupt administration structures, which were appointed by way of Mubarak’s State Security investigations. They demand replacing them with interim impartial administrative councils made up of members of independent teaching agencies not tied to the failed regime. These councils should oversee the repeal of the appointment system which the Mubarak regime set up to choose university administrations. They should also put in place new rules and regulations to organize a free election process among the members of the teaching agencies of each university to choose an elected administration subjected to oversight and held accountable for its mistakes.,The revolutionaries in the universities also demand fair and transparent elections, without restrictions or abuse, for student unions, the implementation of free education, support for university books, and the fall of regulation 2007. They demand a return to working by regulation 76 until the completion of a number of new regulations with the students’ participation. Additionally, they demand the freedom to hold seminars, organize activities within the university, the right to form student groups by giving notice only, reorganizing enrollment procedures, permitting students who entered open education directly from high school following its repeal to relocate to it should they so desire, and founding male and female open education student unions.,[Picture text: A free university, oh my country.],Egyptian university students have struggled for years to get hold of these demands and others. The magnificent revolution in which they participated inspired them, individually at first. Then they came together through it as free students, sitting-in and protesting since the first day of the return of studies. This exists in the framework of completing the revolution’s mission to liberate the universities, cleanse them, and take back their independence from the control of the symbols of Mubarak’s fallen regime.,In Cairo University, the students’ sit-ins have reached inside their colleges’ buildings and in front of the administration building (the Dome) since day one of studies this term. At the time in which they were demanding the fall of the university’s president and its administrative structure, they maintained the continuance of the education process, until even now. This happened in the face of university president Hussam Kamil’s calls for the suspension of classes in the university. Since the students’ sit-in alarmed him, he decided not to be present at the university throughout the two past weeks. The students and honest professors faced these proceedings with the utmost resoluteness and insisted on the resumption of classes. Lectures were organized in most of the colleges before the Minister of Education released an announcement that university classes would not be suspended. The students insist on replacing university administration staff that symbolize the previous regime with others who are acceptable to the students and professors. Their giving up their functions and positions immediately opens a door for serious discussion about the demands of each separate college.,It remains to say that the University of Cairo’s revolutionary students are part of a larger movement which has arisen in most of Egypt’s universities to purify them of the symbols of Mubarak, such as the students of the following universities (and not only these): Hulwan, ‘Ayn Shams, Asyut, al-Mansura, and Alexandria.,Egypt’s students have taken on their shoulders the mission of purifying the country and completing the revolution with the fall of the defunct regime’s symbols in their universities. They face the horns of the counter-revolution, calling for stability and patience for the corrupt accomplices who tarnished the universities and imprisoned them throughout the past decades, until the end of the semester. However, we will not be patient for the corrupt after today. Egypt’s students are in need of the support of every revolutionary and honest person, so support them.,,,Disband the Local Popular Councils Right Now,Among the most powerful remnants of the deposed regime in Egypt are the “Local Popular Councils”, for, as it is said, if the amount of fraudulent votes in the parliamentary elections was 90%, then this number certainly reaches 100% in the Local Councils. This is especially after the enactment of the corrupt constitutional amendments in 2006 which stipulated acquiring majority support from the Local Popular Councils in order to run in the presidential elections.,The January 25th Revolution has brought this regime down along with all that represented it. It does not make sense to make the decision to disband that People’s Assembly and the Shura Council and not apply the same to the Local Councils—for they are more dangerous. They are made up of 52 thousand members across the Republic, and all but 2% are in the National Party. They were where the parliamentary leadership and corrupt politicians had their dumping ground.,The Local Councils crisis is not only attached to their performance and existence as a direct branch of the National Party within every village and city but also to their mandated role of enforcing the current Constitution and what comes from it in terms of laws. Law number 43 of the Local Administration from 1989 states that the Local Councils have a role in supervising different facilities and workers who enter into the governorate’s jurisdiction along with supervision of the implementation of particular plans for local development, following them up, deciding the economic and social development plan, drawing up the yearly budget for the governorate, and following up with its implementation. Additionally, they suggest plans for urban construction and development and approve what facilities, which return profit to the governorate, want. They suggest general regulations for organizing how a governorate’s agencies work with the Republic.,We consider them “illusory functions” in the shadow of a Constitution that does not raise the value of local rule and does not support decentralization. Thus, the demand for disbanding the Local Councils is without a doubt connected to creating a new Constitution that represents a legitimacy created by the Egyptian people’s revolution in order to achieve their hopes. In this way, there will be a role for every individual in determining the plans of his city and the quality of its development, obtaining his rights in full within it. That will not happen except with a complete change doing away with the idea of a single individual and central institutions.,Perhaps the idea of “Popular Committees”—produced during the first days of the revolution for the administration of security within each region and which spontaneously developed after that in the formation of discussion groups and broad interaction among citizens regarding the possibility of developing their governorate’s resources and administering their daily affairs—is an affirmation of the necessity of working to create real popular organizations. Their aim would be the service of the people, not the service of the regime or a corrupt party or individual.,,,,The Revolution and Revolution in the Arab Region,Did the United States suddenly recall that Qaddafi’s regime oppressed protestors? It moved its fleet close to Libya’s shores while the European Union announced the no-fly zone. All that occurred without any real steps to stop the massacres that Qaddafi was committing against his people, just as there was no movement throughout the years of his despotic rule.,The secret word is fear… Fear for oil riches and for popular revolution. The United States was supporting and welcoming dictatorial regimes as long as their loyalty was guaranteed. However, now it is trembling, scared of popular revolutions that aim to be rid of the dictator’s grasp, the exploitation of worldwide monopolies, and subjection to the dictates of colonialism.,The American forces marched to control the situation. If Qaddafi falls, the US will have to guarantee a stable situation, which will allow it to pump Libyan oil. The US is not interested in how many victims fall as long as Qaddafi falls, just as it was not interested in how many victims Mubarak felled in order to protect his throne.,On the other hand, Saudi forces entered Bahraini territory, under the name of “Peninsula Shield Forces”. The first batch of them was made up of 150 armored troop carriers and almost 50 military boats, while eye witnesses mentioned that there were tanks among them. These forces entered at the request of the Bahraini king and with America’s blessing. That came after the Bahraini Workers’ Unions announced a general strike, responded to across the country. At the time, official media—not limited to Bahrain—claimed that is was a sectarian issue, with Shi‘is being agitated by incitement from Iran and Hizbullah. They did not mention that it was a matter of a majority suffering from the rule of the minority, trying to change the population distribution.,The king who made his country into something like a special American base at the entrance of the Gulf is sheltered by Saudi overlords from peaceful revolutions demanding democratic rights which do not affect his throne. The Saudis oppressed the protesters with gunfire and had previously swept through Yemeni lands pursuing the Huthis.,The picture is clear. The interests of Arab regimes are interrelated and associated with American—Zionist colonialism. They are clearly hostile to their working classes and prepared to sacrifice the last drop of blood of the last citizen when faced with protecting their thrones. Is it not rational to note that the lives of revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Yemen are all dependent on each other and dependent on the spread of revolution among the rest of the Arab peoples?,Page 4,Torture: A Crime Before the Revolution and After It,[Picture text: No to torture in the state prisons.],We did not have the time to dream. The murder of Khalid Sa‘id and hundreds of others who were subjected to torture lit the fuse of the January 25th Revolution, which took the first of its many steps by removing the head of the regime, though it was aware from the beginning that this was not its only goal. It knew that the regime was more than Hosni Mubarak, that the regime was corruption, oppression, poverty, unemployment, discrimination between citizens on the bases of religion and gender… It was aware that the regime was open arrest warrants, blank pieces of paper signed off by officers of State Security, and hellish torture that disfigured thousands and killed hundreds… When Mubarak decided, at the end of his maneuvers—before resigning—to appoint ‘Umar Sulayman, Chief of Intelligence, as his Vice President and later give him presidential responsibilities, chants were raised along with signs refusing this most violent perpetrator of torture. He was not satisfied merely to torture Egyptians, but also initiated prisoner exchange with the American administration and some European countries. They began exporting victims to him for torture, given his intimate knowledge of the intelligence and State Security apparatuses.,Before we could demand that those responsible for torture before the 25th of January be held responsible, open the sealed files in the Attorney General’s office, and attempt to categorize and pay reparations to its victims and the families of those killed by torture, we saw a new segment of Egyptians—youths and adults, men and women—subjected to heinous types of torture, leaving whip lashes and electric burns on their bodies, even days after release in some cases. This time, torture was not inflicted by the police, but by army men and the military police: the Egyptian Museum was turned into a prison for the Tahrir revolutionaries, and young men and women were subjected to beating, whipping, and electric prodding before being released or sent to military prisons, where the crimes are repeated in a more brutal manner and with utter disregard for human dignity.,The Egyptian people did not revolt in order to swap one executioner for another, nor did they do so to swap the State Security headquarters and police stations with military prisons. They were not and are not in need of State Security courts being substituted with military ones. They revolted in order to hold accountable those executioners who ruled the country with iron and fire, who stole young adulthood from the youths, and feelings of dignity, security, and hope for a better tomorrow from the Egyptians.,Today, reflecting on the operations to storm the State Security Headquarters, and after listening to yet another witness and seeing yet another picture, you can see how much torture was inflicted by the military in the Egyptian Museum and military prisons. This confirms our fear that most of what goes on in these headquarters has been intentionally destroyed and burned. Nothing is left except a few papers, which they want us to become preoccupied with circulating. In these headquarters, we did not find anyone imprisoned, though we know that thousands are still in chains. We did not find State Security officers, though we found pictures of them. We did not see even one of them brought to justice to account for the crimes he committed. Today, we open a new file for torture, pointing the accusatory finger towards the army’s men. After facing the army’s whips and billy clubs, the victims of torture leave wounded, with gouges in their bodies and strong feelings of anger and humiliation in their souls. While a wounded body is sure to heal as its injuries fade away with time, it is not so for a wounded soul, where memories do not fade away—especially since the victims this time were January 25th revolutionaries. Pictures of the martyrs and the wounded remain before their eyes, and the joy of February 11th, when they saw the sign of victory, remains in their hearts. Many of them still do not want to believe that the hand grasping the whip was that of the military, for whom the people cheered less than two months ago.,The developments over the following days and weeks have proved that the people are the only true guarantee for the revolution’s victory, that the path to victory is long, and that we are still at the beginning.,Torture before January 25th did not end with the passage of time, nor will torture after January 25th. The difference is that anyone who inflicts torture after the 25th of January has the memory of the revolution, and the memory of the revolution does not forget those who joined in solidarity, just as it does not forget those who were disloyal. It knows how to hold someone accountable, even after a time.,,To Contact, Join, and Give Your Suggestions,Facebook: al-Ligan al-Sha’biyya li-l-Difa’ ‘an al-Thawra al-Misriyya [The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Egyptian Revolution],Blog: http://leganthawrya.blogspot.com,E-mail: Leganthawrya@yahoo.com,[Logo text: The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution],,,Central Telephone: [redacted],al-Haram- Faysal- al-‘Umaraniyya: [redacted],Bulaq al-Dakrur: [redacted],al-Ma‘adi – al-Basatin – Dar al-Salam: [redacted],Imbaba: [redacted],al-Jamaliyya: [redacted],al-Sayyida Zaynab: [redacted],al-Shaykh Zayid – 6 October: [redacted],Shubra: [redacted],al-Qanatir al-Khayriyya: [redacted],al-Zaytun: [redacted],Nasr City: [redacted],al-Marg: [redacted],Hulwan: [redacted],al-Saff: [redacted],Alexandria: [redacted],al-Isma‘iliyya: [redacted],Port Sa‘id: [redacted],Kafr al-Shaykh: [redacted],al-Fayum: [redacted],Asyut: [redacted],Bani Suwayf: [redacted],","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164010im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/thawrya4.png,imgID110,
"Why No to the Constitutional Amendments (7000 Years, No, No, No)",2011-04-04,2011,"Why No to the Constitutional Amendments (7,000 Years, No, No, No),,That which is based upon something invalid is invalid [itself],,The regime effectively lost its legitimacy on January 28th. With the fall of the regime, the operative Constitution, which had been distorted and changed in order to answer the requirements of perpetuating and passing on a corrupt and corrupting regime, fell as well. Legitimacy has become revolutionary legitimacy deriving from the people, [the people] that withdrew their trust from the corrupt regime, [its] legislation, and [its] Constitution. Therefore:,,First: In the case of the former president’s resignation, according to the former Constitution, the post of President of the Republic must be assumed by either the head of the People’s Assembly or the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court. As a result [of the fact that] what [actually] happened was the former president’s release of power to the Military Command. The Command, in order to extend its legitimacy to exist in this transitional period, was obligated to work toward the dissolution of the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council (as has happened), suspend the former Constitution that had lost its legitimacy, and announce the establishment of a constituent assembly that would draft a new Constitution for the country. [This new Constitution] would convey the legitimate revolutionary demands of the people, who paid the price for their freedom with the best of their young men. [As such,] it would have been more appropriate for the [Military Command] to announce the drafting of a new Constitution, and not to propose the option of emending some of the provisions in it that the deposed president called to be emended. He lost his legitimacy, and as such it was not his right to dictate his wishes to the [true holders of] revolutionary legitimacy in emending some of the provisions of the Constitution; even these provisions fell along with him. The powers and interests of the President of the Republic have been neglected in the amendment[s], and that is what will transform the holder [of office] once again, in the course of weeks, into a dictator. This is due to the lack of a new constitutional article that defines the powers of the new President of the Republic, a way to prosecute him if he commits crimes during his time in office, and a means for his oversight. Also [contributing to this outcome] is the neglect of particular articles regarding the freedom to found new parties and freedom of the press. Since the new President of the Republic will begin to work on a new Constitution after he assumes the tasks of his post, or after a period of time no less than 9 months, what is to prevent working on a new Constitution now, in the six months during which the Military Command remains in power?,,Second: – Why ‘no’ to the amendments?,,If we take up some of the constitutional articles of amendment that have been proposed:,,1. Article 189:,The President of the Republic may (dependent upon his request) [call for] the election of a constituent assembly of 100 members of the People’s Assembly to draft a new Constitution for the country……… What if he doesn’t call [for it]… and what is the guarantee?,,In the case that [such] a call [is given], the members of the constituent assembly for the drafting of a new Constitution will be elected from the members of the new People’s Assembly, which of course does not represent all the factions of the Egyptian people. This is because of the lack of strong parties in the political landscape in the country’s current state of affairs and the impermissibility of establishing new parties that represent the spectrum of the Egyptian people. Even if there were [such parties], there would not be enough time to display their role to the Egyptian street, and we would remain with one choice in the shadow of the strong presence of organized parties that are widely known to the Egyptian street, like the remnants of the NDP and the [Muslim] Brotherhood. [This would be] just like the situation in the People’s Assembly in 2005. [That Assembly] undertook no effective constitutional amendments, or ones expressing the Egyptian people[’s will], but instead undertook to amend provision 76 and other articles which served to pass on and perpetuate [the regime]. Additionally, [the 2005 People’s Assembly] did not take on a true role in serving the requirements of the Egyptian people and fighting corruption.,,2. Article 139:,The President of the Republic shall appoint one or more Vice Presidents within 60 days – What if he were to appoint his son or his cousin??? What are the mechanisms through which this decision is made, and what are the mechanisms to refuse it?,,3. Article 75:,This article gives stipulations regarding the conditions the President of the Republic must meet, and an article has been added to the effect that no one carrying another nationality, or married to a non-Egyptian woman, even if she is Arab, may run as a candidate. This translates to prejudice in choice and a contradiction to provisions of the law that do not allow for a constitutional article that has retroactive force, especially [because] there was no article in the former Constitution, or in the present law, that prohibited [the President] from holding another nationality.,,4. Article 76:,The conditions for candidacy for the post of President of the Republic have been lightened and simplified such that it now suffices to be nominated by 30,000 citizens from 15 different governorates, with at least 1,000 [citizens] from each governorate; or [to be nominated by] 30 members of the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council; or to be a member of a party that has received [at least] one seat in the People’s Assembly or Shura Council, and to have been nominated by that party. This translates to a violation of the principle of equality in the mechanisms of candidacy.,,Concerning what was previously mentioned:,,If the referendum is approved:,Following from that will be a tacit agreement that the Constitution that will be in force in the period of the new president’s assumption of power until he undertakes work on a new Constitution (9 months) will be the Constitution of 1971 with all of its faults, which will make the holder [of office] a dictator. Also, the People’s Assembly and Shura Council will not represent the people ([as they will be constituted of] the Muslim Brotherhood and the NDP), and that [will be the legislative body] that will undertake the drafting of a new Constitution.,,If the referendum is rejected:,The Military Command will be forced to give in to the people’s desire and its legitimacy, and to announce a constituent assembly to begin work on a new Constitution for the country that will fulfill the wishes and hopes of the Egyptian people after the January 25 Revolution, especially since the Military Command will remain in power for 6 months. This may be enough time to complete a new Constitution, instead of us entering once again into this vortex after presidential elections, while the People’s Assembly and Shura Council [still] do not represent the people.,,(It is incumbent on every honorable Egyptian citizen to distribute this flier to five people around him.),(Freedom / Democracy / Social Justice),May God recompense you well,","Constitution, March Referendum",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130154642im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/WhyNoTo-theConstitutional-Amendments.png,imgID111,
April 6th Youth: Correcting the Path of the Revolution,2011-04-03,2011,"April 6…Correcting the Path of the Jan 25 Revolution,The People Want to Try the Corrupt April 6 Youth,,April 6, 2008 was a historic day in the journey of resistance against the former regime’s corruption, in which the Egyptian people exercised their legitimate right to protest in public civil disobedience against the unjustified raising of prices. This day was chosen to represent an annual occasion for all of the political currents and those with legitimate demands to unite their efforts in peacefully resisting Mubarak’s regime. This day had a great impact in building the Egyptian people’s confidence in their ability to create peaceful change, which was embodied at the end of the Jan 25 Revolution. During the revolution, we succeeded in getting rid of the head of the regime. However, we still have to get rid of its corrupt followers in order to purify the state so conditions can stabilize and the path of true building can begin, without fear of any of the counter-revolution’s schemes. That movement is led by all the followers of the former regime whose cases or resignations from their positions have not yet occurred and who exploit them to cripple the gains of the revolution… Do you remember the call to strike in 2008?,On this April 6th we’ll complete the process of cleansing and demand the accountability of the corrupt. All of the political currents and those demanding purification of the state institutions along with all those who are concerned for the demands of the revolution will gather on this day to return again hand in hand and insist on one set of demands…and they are:,,If you feel these demands express you, then participate with us April 6. We will stand in Tahrir Square from 4 to 8pm after work hours so no one can say we are disturbing public life. Remember, the more able we are to fulfill the demands of the revolution, the faster we achieve stability.,April 6 Youth…Youth that love Egypt,Contact: [phone numbers redacted],www.6april.org,","Movements, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165914im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SixthofApril.png,imgID112,
The National Security Forces Have Not Fallen Yet,2011-04-03,2011,"Voice of the Revolution, #7, Page 2,The National Security Forces have not fallen yet,,As thousands of Egyptians stormed the strongholds of the Secret Police of the National Security Forces, its soldiers were trying to burn the documents in order to erase the evidence of their acts of torture and murder that revealed that this organization not only was the actual ruler of Egypt but that it also planned many egregious violations of the rights of the country, the most glaring of which were the bombing of the Church of al-Qidiseen in Alexandria1 and the explosions in Sharm al-Sheikh.,Some, especially the agents of the counter-revolution, have tried to fool us into believing that there are secret police organizations in all countries of the world. However, the truth is that you do not find an organization above the law in the democratic countries of the world. The Secret Police own secret prison cells beneath ground, and they carry out acts of torture against political opposition of all varieties till the point of death, while they are not subject to any reckoning for their sins.,The storming of the strongholds of the Secret Police or the freezing of their operations does not mean that they have been defeated. The powers of the counter-Revolution will fight desperately in order to save this organization even if it has changed its name and adjusted the way it looks.,The old regime is still strong and ruling despite the fall of Hosni Mubarak and various markers of his regime. It is not a coincidence that the Armed forces have dealt with those who attempted to storm the stronghold of Lazughli with extreme violence including electric-shock and torture, because it has copies of all the documents from the other bases. The dissolution of the Secret Police is a goal that is as important as the removal of Mubarak! Therefore the struggle must continue to remove this organization so that it may never return.,","Regime, Security Forces",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155717im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/VoiceoftheRevolution-MuslimsandCopts.png,imgID113,
The Army and the People…Do Not Stand Hand in Hand,2011-04-03,2011,"Voice of the Revolution, #7, Page 2,The Army and the People…They do not Stand Hand in Hand,Last Thursday, we saw the Army break up the sit-ins in Tahrir square with force and seize tens of demonstrators. The extreme violence, which the army used to subdue hundreds of protestors, the similar repression they used with the demonstrators who tried to enter State Security’s stronghold in Lazghuli, and the unjustified violence which they used in breaking up the sit-in of the post office employees in Fayum raise huge questions about the Army’s stance on the workers and popular movements. As for the negative stance that the army took towards the acts of sectarian violence, this is another reason to question the army’s fitness to act as protector and arbiter in the face of the sectarianism created by the vanquishing of the ousted regime.,In every situation the protestors shout, “the people and the army walk united hand in hand,” but it is clear that these shouts are not true and the people and the army are not “hand in hand.” Rather they are proponents of two different things. The army only follows the popular course when it seems that popular pressure may force them out and when there are no glaringly obvious contradiction between their interests and those of the people.,The revolution has shown us that the people’s struggle in the street is the way for change, and there is no other way. As for the statement that the army and the people are “hand in hand,” this will lead us in the end to surrender to the original position of waiting for the government to fulfill our demands. And this is contrary to what our experience has shown us; that popular struggle is the only way to achieve our demands. Thus, what we need is to lay out our demands clearly and then struggle for them as one, pursuing this manner until we force the Army and the government to yield to the demands of the masses. What has happened with the Security Forces is the clearest example of this. Since the victory of the Revolution, we have been demanding the dissolution of the institutions of the Security Forces and the arraignment of those responsible for this, but as no one has done anything, the masses have decided to take the reins of the matter and achieve their objectives.,What the Army did, while some consider it surprising, is only natural when you look at the nature of the Army. For although it came into power because of the Revolution, it was always part of the old regime, and its leadership was chosen by Mubarak when he ruled.,Therefore, we must have confidence in ourselves, in our struggle, and in the unions, confederations, and committees created to protect the revolution. These structures are able to express and defend our true desires.,,",Military,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144642im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/VoiceoftheRevolution-MuslimsandCopts.png,imgID114,

The Popular Alliance Party: Foundational Declaration,2011-04-02,2011,",On January 25, 2011, the Egyptian youth set off a glorious revolution that formed a landmark in our history, indeed, in the history of the entire world, and throughout the days the scope of the youth spark expanded to transform into a mighty, popular revolution that millions of sons and daughters of the Egyptian people and its industrious masses participated in, to grant it great momentum and a fighting power, pulled by intensity of the youth vanguard. The revolution succeeded in getting rid of Mubarak the dictator and many of those wrapped around him who monopolized power and wealth and were devoted to corruption and authoritarianism, thus launching the birth of a new nation, and cutting off the first steps of a long procession that sought the removal of all of the political and social demands of the masses.,,The revolution exploded in the backdrop of a general overpowering feeling of social injustice because of biased economic policies favoring the rich and the astronomical wealth made by the gang of corruption and authoritarianism by the blood of the people through their starvation, poverty, and exploitation. And while millions of Egyptians live in huts and sleep on sidewalks and suffer from hunger and bareness, palaces and resorts that no one lives in are built and markets are flooded with tons of food and clothes that no one buys. This in addition to the collapse of education and health services and the theft of pension funds and the decrease of all social securities.,,The people wanted the fall of the regime that destroyed the national economy so that tourism, trade, and luxurious real estate sectors would prosper, while agricultural industry declined. This economy became unable to provide work opportunities, which pushed millions of youth into the chasm of unemployment and to risk death in migration boats escaping an inhuman life.,,In the shadow of these policies, culture and art were transformed into commodities controlled by the business mafia and the laws of the market, or besieged by the administrative-bureaucratic apparatus; and the result is the distortion of consciousness and sentiment and the decline of culture and arts and all the fields of creativity and the blocking the way in the face of the creators that drilled rock so that some of their creativity could see light.,,The revolution succeeded in aborting the criminal attempts of the Mubarak regime to spark sectarian strife among the ranks of the people, and the attempts to isolate Christians from the political movement; and it succeeded in transforming the slogan: “Religion is for God and the nation is for all” from merely a slogan into a living, tangible reality throughout the days of the sit-ins in Tahrir square. Likewise, the peaceful, yet fighting nature of the revolution and the climate of national fraternity that was predominant in it, led to the people of the world standing with our revolution, and even became an inspiring example to all people who struggle for the sake of democracy and social justice.,,At the heart of the popular struggle appeared the face of Egypt the fighter that removes its burden of the dust of years of stagnation, and massive brigades of new fighters raising the slogan of struggle for the sake of democracy and justice stepped out into the light. And at the heart of the revolution were currents and powers of the Egyptian left and fighters for the sake of a socialism that equalizes humans without discrimination or hegemony or monopoly or exclusion, working side by side with the rest of the democratic and youth powers and all of the change groups for the sake of the victory of the revolution. The struggling youth’s desire for change for the sake of freedom and social justice converged with the powers of the Egyptian left, which represents a large branch of our people’s fighting legacy for the sake of liberation and democracy and social justice.,,The Popular Alliance Party is born from the womb of the revolution, and is open to all democratic, progressive, leftist, and socialist powers that struggle together for the sake of the slogans that the revolution embraced: “change, freedom, social justice, and human dignity.”,,The Party Sets Out A Number of Main Positions that Reflect the Demands of the Masses of the January 25 Revolution:,,First: An insistence on the realization of all the demands specific to democratization and political reform without exception, including the necessity of removing all staff of the old regime from power, the transferral of power to a civil, temporary government, the dissolution of the local houses [of Parliament], the cancellation of the emergency law and the special courts and the laws restricting freedoms, the release of all detainees, and the trial of the symbols of corruption and authoritarianism. These demands include the drafting of a new constitution that confirms the principle of the separation of powers and ends the hegemony of the executive power over the legislative and judicial powers, and makes security institutions subordinate to popular civil supervision, and confirms the independence of the judges and Egypt’s worthiness of a real Parliament that enjoys powers of supervision and legislation with the removal of all restrictions on establishing parties and unions and associations and printing newspapers.,,Second: Tying political change to social change in a framework of unity and integration of human rights, and a redirection of the economy and setting out of development plans in the interest of the poor masses of laborers, peasants, employees, marginalized, small business-owners, and artisans in Egypt, guaranteeing their rights to nourishment, habitation, education, work, fair wages, healthcare, and confrontation of economic and social exploitation and monopolizing hegemony; setting the minimum and maximum wage, tying wages to prices, the payment of unemployment benefits and loans to due small farmers and craftsmen, directing public spending toward the improvement of services, the imposition of progressive taxation on the wealthy, and the implementation of radical agricultural reform.,,Third: The confrontation of all forms subordinate to Zionism and colonial governments, including confronting normalization with Israel, and supporting the struggle of the Arab peoples and all the people of the world for the sake of democracy and liberation, and supporting the Palestinian people in order to realize their freedoms and establish their state, and supporting every form of resistance to colonialism, including armed resistance, with the refusal of violent acts against isolated civilians.,,Fourth: The struggle for a civil state, neither religious nor military, and the affirmation of the separation of religion and politics, and the confrontation of all forms of discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, race, political ideology, or class belonging, and the struggle for freedom of thought, expression, creativity, and scientific research.,,The Popular Alliance Party is a party opposed to capitalist exploitation, hegemony, and monopolies. And it is biased toward the interest of the poor and the producers. It diligently seeks to invite the laborers, peasants, employees, and all the poor masses to join its ranks, with all the youth that refuse corruption and authoritarianism and exploitation, and all the intellectuals and creators and those biased toward democracy and justice from the various classes and sectors. It is an open, democratic party that allows for a plurality of platforms and orientations and voices within it. Its political positions arouse harmony between the various political currents; its bodies are formed and its decisions taken building on democratic regulations.,,Join us….fight with us..,,,Temporary Headquarters,The Headquarters of the Socialist Renewal Current,2 Hussein Basha al Mamar- from Mahmoud Bassiouny- Talat Harb Square- Downtown, 3rd floor,The Crescent Institution for Freedoms,5 Mohamed Sidqi St- from Huda Sharawy- Bab Al Luq- Downtown- 1st floor- Telephone: [number redacted],","Politics, The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151751im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/PartyofPopularAlliance.jpg,imgID116,
National Front for Justice and Democracy,2011-05-31,2011,",The National Front for Justice and Democracy was formed in Egypt in the aftermath of the January 25th Revolution to work towards realizing the revolution’s goals and cementing its gains in society. The National Front was founded after the noticeable increase in the danger of revolution’s momentum being exploited by numerous powers in Egypt that are pushing the revolution down paths opposed to the ambitions of the participants and the principles of the revolution itself. The most important of these powers include the remnants of the old regime, its political party, and its corrupt security organizations. They also include the centers of financial power and influence that were created in the age of the defunct regime, a number of opposition groups that are attempting to invest in the revolution in order to serve their own narrow interests, and the American-Zionist colonization and its collaborators.,Thus, the National Front was formed to challenge the dangerous plans of these powers by working to represent the interests of the popular majority that undertook the revolution and worked towards its success, especially after it became clear that more than 80% of the people that engaged in the events and activities of the revolution do not belong to any party or political organization – whether legitimate or otherwise – and do not have any platforms to represent their positions. Stemming from this, there is an ignorance of their views, interests, and rights in the process of forming a new country because they lack the organization of political platforms, and this situation causes serious difficulties for the principles of the revolution and a complete concealment of its merits. From this, the necessity of creating a new platform that unites this unrepresented majority and strives towards the realization of the goals upon which you all agree on became apparent. These goals are:,,First: Implanting and Protecting Democracy,,All signs indicate that the nascent democracy of January 25th will, regrettably, become distorted, profoundly lacking the components that give it resilience and stability. The process of democratic transition and the elections that it will produce are being planned and administered with an unjustified speed that will inevitably lead to the exclusion of everyone who is not politically organized, and will limit the available time for those people to organize themselves and defend their thoughts in a healthy democratic environment. This situation will consequently reduce their ability to compete with the more advanced and well-run organizations that existed on the scene before the revolution. Since the majority of those who undertook the revolution did not belong to any organizations that predate the revolution, the path has been closed to them, and as the excluded revolutionary majority, they have not been given the opportunity to present their views to society. Thus, the National Front will work to organize this majority in order to stabilize this democratic transition.,,Second: Combating Corruption and Destroying its Structures,,Everyone knows how widespread corruption is in Egypt and how rooted its structure is in all corners of the state and society. For this reason, confronting corruption and recovering looted money and resources have become two of the most important goals of the revolution and of Egyptian society generally, just as they are among the most important of the transitional regime’s stated goals. Regrettably, however, we have seen how the transitional regime has entrusted the old, pre-revolutionary surveillance and accountability apparatuses, which do not fall outside the realm of the corrupt relations that ran rampant in pre-revolutionary society, with holding the corrupt individuals accountable and returning what was looted from the state’s riches. Furthermore, the transitional regime’s delay in holding those corrupt individuals accountable and confronting corruption gives the corrupt a sufficient amount of time to organize their affairs, smuggle their money, and conceal incriminating evidence by shredding and burning, as we have seen. Thus, it is our responsibility to form popular, just, and effective frameworks to monitor corruption, hold the corrupt accountable, and seek the return of looted riches. The legitimacy and vitality of these frameworks derives from their popular support.,,Third: Achieving Social Justice,,We have observed the indifference of political powers to – and even their criminalization of – the principle of social justice. This indifference is usually manifested in attacks not only on labor strikes but also on the interests of the poor. It is also manifested in the continuation of the same economic policies, which are biased towards the richest of the rich in Egypt, that the corrupt Mubarak regime pursued under the name of “Building Egypt” and returning vitality to the Egyptian economy. Thus, organized frameworks were formed in order to spread and defend a better understanding of social justice, as well as to create an acceptable picture of the means of achieving both social justice and new economic relations in society, both of which are believed to be urgently needed right now.,,Fourth: Working Towards Changing Domestic Policy, and Engagement in All Types of National Dialogue and Joint Projects,,It is our responsibility to start a healthy dialogue and work with all other political movements to form the best governmental, political, and constitutional environment for the coming period without excluding any side. We must strive to single out points of agreement and likely shared projects between the National Front and other political groups, just as we must coordinate our work with other political movements whenever possible.,,Fifth: Pressure for the Sake of an Independent, Patriotic Foreign Policy,,For centuries, Egypt has suffered colonial schemes that interfered in matters of governance, tyrannizing its people and resources. Contemporary colonialism has manifested itself through endorsing the corrupt client regime that supports the interests of foreign powers at the expense of the interests of the country and her citizens. In exchange for this endorsement, it keeps the client regime in power. For this reason, we must push for a foreign policy that works for Egypt by securing the interests of the country and its people, as well as the independence of the state, without groveling to or working for the interests of other states and peoples, as was the case in the past. Every national power must work to forbid the exploitation of the revolution to reproduce the same colonial system that corrupted the Egyptian state over the past four decades. They must also work to protect the nascent democracy from any such attempts if they hope to implement an independent, patriotic, free state that deals with the world only for the interests of its people.,,Sixth: Influencing the Results of the Elections as Much as Possible,,We must strive to put specific policies onto the electoral stage and participate in dialogue with the nominees to realize these policies in the different electoral programs of each nominee. We will support those who we consider to be in line with, and working to achieve, the goals of the National Front.,,Seventh: Achieving Security and Stability for the Country,,Restoring the stability and security of the country is a central goal which Egyptians are striving to achieve. Thus, we must publicly rebuild the police force with a new philosophy, specifically and explicitly different strategies, and a restructuring of this apparatus based on different basic principles.,,Working Methods:,,The National Front depends on numerous methods for realizing the previously mentioned goals. Here are some of the most important methods:,,Popular Pressure,,Popular pressure in its two most effective forms (protests and strikes) is a fundamental democratic right and a project for every person to undertake. Any attacks on this right, or attempts to snatch it away, are unacceptable. It is therefore necessary to defend the legitimacy of this right and the ability to practice it in complete freedom.,,Media Pressure,,We will work to create and deepen beneficial relationships with traditional media platforms, as well as establish alternative platforms, to spread the principles of the National Front and counter the regressive principles being spread by the counter-revolution.,,Cultural Education and Spreading Awareness,,We will rely on research and creativity in order to expose the critical issues that have been glossed over, distorted, or ignored, and spread useful information connected to the goals of the National Front – through projects, activities, and cutting-edge educational materials.,,Geographic Expansion: Working on the Ground and in Various Sites,,Media and fieldwork in the capital and large cities is not enough. We must overcome this usual focus and work with different groups, like unions, different groups of activists, intellectuals, artists, workers, etc. We must also strive to spread out geographically in the governates and different areas.,,INTERNAL ORGANIZATION,The Coordinating Committee,,The Coordinating Committee is the committee assigned to administer the affairs of the National Front and decide its policies in light of its public goals. The Coordinating Committee is composed of thirteen members who were the nucleus of the Front’s formation in addition to its founding members and representatives from the different governates in which public rules were developed for the Front.

"The Democratic Workers Party: On Labor Day, Our Revolution Continues",2011-05-29,2011,"On Labor Day, Our Revolution Continues,On this day, in the past and continuing to the present moment, workers in every corner of the world are celebrating their holiday. But in Egypt, and this year especially, Labor Day arrives crowned with victories. The greatest of these is that which demonstrated the fundamental role of the working classes in political conflict. The fall of Mubarak, despite the magnitude of the event, is nonetheless merely the beginning of a long struggle to be rid of the rest of the ousted regime.,,In the days before Mubarak’s fall, the world had almost forgotten Tahrir Square. It had almost become only an open space for chanting, and life went on normally around it. This was manifested in Shafiq’s cynicism when he announced that the government would distribute sweets to those sitting-in.,,Alongside the regime’s floundering and its intransigence, represented in Mubarak’s last speech, the working classes initiated events that struck the ousted regime at its core. At this time, the critical political power of the working class was proven beyond a doubt, verifying that it is impossible to separate the struggle of the worker from the political struggle. The dozens of demonstrations that swept the country signaled that the fall of the regime was approaching.,,These events inspired many of us. First, it deepened our belief in the strength of the working class and the unity of its struggle. Second, it confirmed for us that the Egyptian working class is due many benefits that now it has no choice but to seize. This is especially clear following the response to the revolution from the educated and the capitalist elite after the fall of Mubarak. Their attacks on the workers’ movements and their description of the class struggles were driven by the remnants of the defunct regime. In summary, the elites’ response could in legal terms be called a criminalization of sit-ins.,,We see that the Egyptian working class, with their proven leadership in past political conflicts, and consequently its importance in determining the characteristics of society in the days to come, still deserves a great deal.,,1 – A minimum wage, that provides a minimum standard of living tied to rising prices.,,2 – Organizing independent unions. We must have, as a unified working class, organized and independent unions. This is the necessary substitute for the Union of Government Workers, which were merely a tool in the hand of Mubarak’s regime. This union previously condemned the celebration of Labor Day, the first and perhaps last of its kind.,,3 – The Workers Party. We do not only deserve a fair wage and independent unions. We also deserve an independent advocacy organization that expresses our political power as a class responsible for building society and its families. We need an independent political party, without the involvement of the elite that abandoned us for narrow gains and without the involvement of businessmen or government officials. We need an independent political party, not only to exercise our rights through legislation and parliamentary oversight, but also because the class that brought down Mubarak, alongside the students, craftsmen, youth, and sons of the middle class, deserves to have independent political instruments against the politics of privatization, looting, and planning that insures the well-being of businessmen and property owners.,,Today we must reply to the slogans that we heard for so long, from Mubarak and his men in political assemblies and the National Party and the Union of Government Workers. Today we as a society must respond with the slogan: “Oh workers of Egypt, unite …”,,The Democratic Workers Party,First of May, 2011,To contact by phone: [telephone #s redacted],Email: 7ezebalommal@gmail.com,The Party’s page on Facebook is called “The Voice of the Worker”,Foundational Representative: Engineer Kamal Khalil,,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162322im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ourrevolutioncontinues.png,imgID119,
The Liberation of Cairo is Not Complete Without the Liberation of Jerusalem,2011-05-29,2011,",Contact: [phone #s redacted],,Egyptians and Palestinians have long promoted the slogan “the liberation of Jerusalem begins with the liberation of Cairo.” We have long believed that the path to the liberation of Jerusalem depends on the Egyptian populace rising up to break their shackles and liberate themselves from the oppressive regime that supports the Zionist entity.,The Zionist entity worked for decades to weaken Egypt, by supporting authoritarian rulers who guaranteed their loyalty. These rulers oppressed the Egyptian people: they made them poor, marginalized them, and excluded them from politics and decision making. They stole the country’s resources to serve their own interests. They allowed the Zionists to rule the country and enabled its usurpation. There is no share for the Egyptians in their country and they have no say in delineating its policies. Instead, the decisions are left to Washington and Tel Aviv.,At the same time, these leaders neutralized Egypt, isolated it from the surrounding Arab and African nations, and transformed it into their follower rather than allowing it to play its natural role in leading movements of national liberation.,Now, the Egyptian people have risen up demanding freedom and social justice and have taken the first steps towards overthrowing the corrupt regime that plagued them for decades. The Zionist entity is in imminent danger, and its end is now inevitable following the victory of the Egyptian revolution specifically along with its corollaries in Syria, Jordan, and other Arab countries. With that, the Zionist enemy will not surrender so easily and allow the revolution to take the reins of power in Egypt and to implement the desire of the people. However, it will work diligently to appease the Egyptian people, to compliment their revolution, and to focus the media on the fact that it is nothing more than a democratic revolution, having no relationship to liberation from the Zionist influence. At the same time, it will try to get out of its dilemma by supporting the regime so it will not collapse or by forming a new regime that pursues the same policies and is made up of the supposed opposition to the former regime and some businessmen.,The center of the counter-revolution is in Tel Aviv, not within the National Democratic Party as some think. The National Democratic Party and the supporters of the regime are nothing but tools used to execute Zionist policies in agreement with their interests. The Zionist entity is the one that is pressuring not to prosecute the ousted Mubarak and it is the one that allowed the Egyptian Army to increase its presence in Sinai (which violates the conditions of the despicable Camp David Accords) for its protection. It is the one that supports fueling sectarian strife among the Egyptian Muslims and Christians. It is supporting (through the military and other organizations) particular political currents and groups in gaining the power of rule and forming the new regime in Egypt. It is pressuring the trivialization of the revolution, stopping it at the borders of its democratic demands without having reached change in the economic system and national politics.,We can easily tell that Mubarak and his regime are not just Zionist occupiers. In fact, they are one in the same. However, we must be aware that Zionism did not surrender with the fall of Mubarak. They will strive even harder to create a similar figure with more democracy (in form) to protect their existence and interests.,My fellow Egyptians, the enemies are restive and scared to death of the Egyptian revolution. Let us meet their expectations. Let us complete our revolution and make it the end of this entity and the end of the Zionist colonial project in the region forever.,,A group of independents and political movements, we believe completely that the liberation of Cairo will not happen without the liberation of Jerusalem. Our values: We do not recognize the Zionist entity and we consider it an illegal, nefarious entity. We believe in the right of return for all Arabs illegally forced from their land and homes. Our struggle is not against the Jews, as coreligionists, but against Zionism: those that believe in the right of the “Jews” to the Zionist Occupation of the land between the Nile and Furat rivers. The Jews that are against Zionism are our allies, whereas the Arabs, Muslims and Christians that are loyal to Zionism are our enemies. Palestine is an originally Egyptian issue and is not an issue of “Brotherly People” as much as it is an issue of the Egyptian people. The hostile entity stationed at the borders of Egypt was not and will not be satisfied with the occupation of Palestine, as it has stretched its invisible influence to Egypt and other Arab countries.,Before May 15th, we planned: awareness campaigns in streets, neighborhoods, and Egyptian universities.,On May 13th, an assembly in Tahrir Square and a people’s march to the Embassy of the Zionist Entity in Giza.,On May 14th, an assembly at 9:00 AM in Tahrir Square moving, at 12:00 PM, to Gaza and surrounding the home of the Zionist ambassador in Maadi (for those who would not participate in the march).,Goals of the march: ensuring the right of return for all Palestinian refugees and migrants and permanently opening the Rafah,Crossing, stopping the exportation of Egyptian gas to the Zionist entity, canceling all the humiliating agreements and treaties and boycotting all commercial and political relations with them, and freeing all Palestinian prisoners in Egyptian prisons. This will be done in the context of the struggle to achieve the principle goal of the Occupied Territories’ complete liberation.,Egypt suffered over thirty years of negative effects from the Camp David Accords, which Anwar Sadat signed with the Zionist entity in 1979, starting from the word “peace.”,Besides the fact that the agreement shrunk Egypt’s role in offering assistance to our people in Palestine it also violates international legislation and laws and represents the shame and humiliation of the Egyptian side since the first day of its signing.,The ousted President Mubarak’s regime exploited the agreement to export Egyptian gas at the cheapest prices to the Zionist entity, which killed our martyrs in 1973 and still kills and rapes a land that was not for one day rightfully theirs: Palestine.,The Agreement violated the Egyptian Constitution when Sadat signed it without first going through the People’s Assembly. Additionally, it violated it by isolating Egypt from its Arab neighbors, while constitution states that “Egypt is part of the Arab Nation.”,It violated the Vienna Convention concerning international treaties, which confirmed that “Each treaty is considered invalid if it violates a peremptory rule of the rules of international law.” This is what happened.,The General Assembly of the United Nations issued a number of resolutions, among them Resolution 34/65 on 11/29/1979 confirming the invalidity of the Agreement because it violated all bases of international law and its provisions.,Under this Agreement, Egypt resigned national sovereignty of part of its land when its leaders agreed to partial sovereignty of Sinai.The Agreement forced it to relocate its military airports in Sinai to civilian airports, forbidden from being used for military purposes. Vast areas of Sinai were left without arms, and other areas there may be no military presence at all, which has left two-thirds of Sinai unarmed. Therefore, Sinai is difficult to defend should the Zionist entity want to reoccupy it―as it has threatened to do on more than one occasion. It is an agreement to plunder the Egyptian will, and not an agreement for peace.,Among the most dangerous effects of Camp David is the First Article in the third paragraph which says: “after the interim withdrawal is complete, normal relations will be established between Egypt and Israel.” The article is in clear violation of Article Three of the Constitution, which recognizes the people’s right to sovereignty.,In the case that Egypt reconsidered or rescinded the Agreement, this would not be a declaration of war, as some claim, because the Zionist entity has breached the Agreement several times. This gives the Egyptian side the right to nullify it. Therefore, the time has come, following the January 25th Revolution, for Egypt to regain sovereignty over its land along with its true supporting role regarding the Palestinian Issue and the right of Palestinians to live in their lands.,This is what the occupation does by erasing the Arab identity from Palestine, obliterating our civilization, displacing its people, and replacing them with foreign settlers.,Judaization attempts began in 1918 with the beginning of Zionist migration to Palestine and has taken several forms, such as changing names of Arab regions to Hebrew names: renaming the region of Haifa and ‘Akka to “’Ashir”, Ram Allah to “Ephraim”, Till Al-Rabi‘a to “Tel Aviv”, and al-Khalil to “’Ayr Hebron”. We also find that names of geographic features have been changed to Hebrew, like Lake Tabariyya to “Yam Hagalil” and the Khalil Mountains and Nablus to “Harem Yehuda and Shomron.” We do not forget the destruction of Islamic and Christian historical sites, for we have witnessed the building of a Jewish synagogue in the largest part of the Sanctuary of Abraham, blowing up the stairs leading to it, and demolishing the well adjacent to it, along with the destruction of a Greek Orthodox church in Jerusalem, and an attempt to burn the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1971, as well as placing all of them on what is called the “list of Jewish heritage sites.”,We do not overlook the confiscation of Arab lands and homes and giving them to foreigners or building settlements on them, such as occurred in the industrial area of Ma‘aleh Adumim which was built on the area of al-Khan al-Ahmar near Jerusalem in 1975. It was then converted into a settlement, which led to the confiscation of more land, expanding its area to 62 square kilometers. It includes a Judaization plan for the city of Jerusalem, where the number of settlers reaches 32,000 Zionists, changing the demography of the country.,The army of the Zionist Occupation uses the most brutal, harsh methods to execute its Judaization schemes. The locals face it by desperately resisting, clinging to the land, and protecting its Arab sites, culture, and sanctity.,The village of Umm Rashrash is part of the Egyptian lands that are still under the Zionist occupation. Umm Rashrash is located at the tip of the Gulf of Aqaba bordering Occupied Palestine.,It is an important and vital port of the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea. Its area stretches 15 square kilometers, and it was under Egyptian sovereignty until the night of March 10, 1949 when some Jewish gangs under the leadership of Yitzhak Rabin (Prime Minister of the Zionist Entity from 1992-1995) attacked Umm Rashrash in a barbaric operation called Operation Uvda, violating of the truce between Egypt and the Zionists.,They killed Egyptian police forces protecting the village, numbering 350 officers and soldiers, despite their adherence to the ceasefire agreement.,The Zionists occupied Umm Rashrash and changed it into the “Port of Eilat” in 1952.,Several movements and blocs of people demanded the reclamation of this part of the Egyptian lands but encountered media blackout and indifference. Umm Rashrash is still a wounded part of Egypt.,To participate in the march, please register at the following site: http://j.mp/15MayMasrTo contact: http://www.facebook.com/intifada15.5,","Palestine, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153102im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A5%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3-11.png,imgID120,
Egyptian Student Union,2011-05-28,2011,"What is The Egyptian Student Union?,The Egyptian Student Union is an organization aiming to unite three million private and public university students under one umbrella to speak as one and act as one.,This Union is not our invention!,The Egyptian Student Union was operating until its self-destruction, having been aborted by the decree of 1979. This Union was represented in the People’s Assembly and presented the problems, the hopes, and the dreams of Egyptian Students directly to the President of the Republic. There was an attempt to reinstate it in the summer of 2010 by the American University in Cairo’s student union, but, instead, was thwarted by state security.,,Why do we need to form the Egyptian Student Union?,The Egyptian universities were once houses of knowledge, schools for politics, and beacons for the rational. They were the biggest school for the creation of correct political policy. The university was a measuring-stick for the nation’s pulse. The students participated in the revolution against the occupation and against corruption for the freedom of Egypt.,The revolution demonstrated that the youth and the workers are the backbone of the Egyptian community. The youth advanced and called for the revolution and the labor strikes which led to the success of the revolution. Most of these young people were university students. There are three million students in public and private universities in Egypt, but, unfortunately, they are not united. If we succeed in unifying all of these students, perhaps we will have a strong political force; maybe we can affect the political situation in Egypt in a positive way.,The Egyptian Student Union must work on the students’ situation and reinvigorate them to go out into professional life. Then, they will be able to work for the good of our beloved Egypt.,,Who are we?,We are a group of university students who have witnessed attempts to restart the work of The Egyptian Student Union that was once brought down by state security. Despite past failures, we still think that we will be able to fulfill the dream, restore ideas for action, and continue these attempts. Right now we are gathering all of the student unions from all of the Egyptian universities and are dispersing the idea among students of these universities. If you want help, please join us in spreading this idea.,","Solidarity, Unions",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152952im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Egyptian-Student-Union.png,imgID121,

Formed undemocratically in 1975, the true writers broke away from the Union, and it was monopolized by those having no relation to literature. Successive leaders upheld this system, remaining in the administration for the whole of their lives and maintaining a syndicate whose only function was to supply them with money for their material interests. Thus they corrupted the literary establishment, and destroyed Egypt’s cultural strategy in the Middle East. The principle of government support for culture and intellectuals ended, and culture is no longer one of the most important manifestations of our civilization as it previously was.

The Popular Revolution: Statement Number 1,2011-05-20,2011,",Statement Number 1 from the Popular Revolution,,Possible dangers and the revolutionary movement’s tactics,,Under the pressure from the enemies of the revolution to spread anarchy and division within the army, the Military Council found itself forced to take quick and unexpected steps against some of the symbols of our great popular revolution’s domestic enemies. The collaborator public prosecutor issued orders to detain and investigate a number of the regime’s most prominent symbols caught up in this plot. The government has also undertaken a review to change some governors to assure the partial execution of the Revolution’s demands (note that not one governor has been selected with the agreement of the people, nor has the people’s glorious revolution’s opinion been sought!!). The speed of these developments clarifies the extent of the pressures that have been put on the Military Council. It also clarifies why the Council has asked for quick and total aid from the revolutionaries to frustrate the anti-revolutionary forces’ internal conspiracy which has begun to threaten the unity of the army. In spite of the inadequacy of the steps which the Council has taken, the observations of its role in solving crises, the threat of martial law being imposed, the enormous threats of the foreign conspiracy, which will manifest itself in the reactions and attempted interference on the part of Israel, America, and reactionary Arab forces—predominantly the Saudi regime—with the help domestically of the remnants of the previous regime, demands from us that for the army and the people to cling together ever more strongly to frustrate the attempts to violate Egyptian security from the outside with full awareness, resoluteness, and speed. At the very least certain acts by foreign intelligence services, such as attempts at political assassination or movements of schism within the army or explosions, fires, and sectarian disorder like what has begun in “Abu Qarqas.” are to be expected during the next week as a sharp response to the Military Council’s most recent movement, at the very least.,,In addition to the latest development from the Military Council, the transitional government’s actions have sent clear messages to the West and to the Arab reactionaries that clearly show that Egypt’s policy towards Africa and Iran is moving forward. Likewise the discussion of large national projects like Tushka or Mamarr al-Tanmiyya, The Corridor of Progress, gives a clear signal of the orientation of the policies in the coming era, which will be full of changes, and of Egypt’s return at the expense of the role of the West (foremost America and Israel) and Arab reactionaries as exemplified by Saudi Arabia. All of that propels the forces that are against the popular revolution (domestic and foreign) to take decisive, quick, and practical steps before the Egyptian threats to their interests in the region become too strong. For this reason the internal and external threats are now stronger than ever before. This demands a high degree of consciousness and quick and direct action on the part of the revolutionary forces to definitively finish off those dangers and to deliver a strong message to the counterrevolutionaries (in Egypt and abroad) that the army, the revolutionaries, and the people are one hand irrespective of the core disagreements with the Military Council. Whosoever threatens Egypt’s security will be found out by the revolution and the people on the basis that he is a strategic enemy. Additionally there must be a clear diplomatic message sent to the western embassies to state that what is happening in Egypt is a domestic affair which no one has the right to interfere with in any way, and that the states that cooperate with Egypt in the current phase will be considered a strategic friend.,,Before the latest bold step which the Military Council was forced to take, it was likely that there would be million-person demonstrations throughout Egypt under the slogan “Friday of Deliverance” from the conspirator public prosecutor, the completion of the popular trial of Mubarak and his corrupt government, and the return from abroad of Egypt’s plundered wealth. But considering the external and internal dangers which we have described, we recommend that the coming Friday be the “Friday of Unity of the Revolution and the Army to Thwart the Conspiracy and to Support Progress.” There is the idea out there of a strong campaign through the internet and Facebook targeting young activists from Western countries (in addition to Egyptian activists living abroad) to refrain from interfering in Egypt’s affairs, and to support Egypt’s efforts to return money that was smuggled to those countries, and likewise to help us revive our economy and to energize, develop, and modernize the touristic enterprise and the way we interact with guests coming to Egypt. At the same time, in order to reinforce the political pressure, let groups of side protests break off from the million person protests (every Friday) in front of various embassies, such as: Italy, France, Israel, Saudi Arabic, the United States, Russia, England, the European Union, and Ethiopia (regarding their infringement upon our water security and the building of the Millennium Dam). They will deliver a strongly-formulated statement to these countries’ ambassadors laying out the following thoughts:,,1) The differences in opinion with the Military Council as a temporary administration for the country does not mean that there are disagreements between the revolutionaries and the army, for both of them are a single organ in the body of the Egyptian people. Revolutionaries are nothing if not the vanguard of the people, and the army is its personal guard entrusted to protect the products of our people including the January 25 revolution. The Military Council is merely a passing administration. The states which are conspiring together to weaken Egypt or which seek to interfere in Egypt’s internal affairs or to influence its role in foreign affairs – will face a great firmness on the part of the people and the forces of the revolution, in addition to their being considered antagonist countries on the strategic and future levels [sic]. They will face strategies and policies hostile to what they are trying to commit against our country in the current period.,,2) Our white revolution has only now just begun, and we are intent with all seriousness upon completing it, with the goal of returning Egypt to its right place on the regional and global stage as a modern democratic country.,,On a civilized basis, Natural Law is ruling upon the errant and corrupt politicians including the president of the state, without any extraordinary steps. (Here we must make note of the fact that the youth of the revolution will be following the trials and will confirm them if they are just and reject them if they should be tainted by bias or collaboration so that the perpetrators will not escape from punishment or have their sentences reduced.) That will to prepare the way for the return of the money they illegally smuggled out of our country. Let the natural trials not last too long, so that we can resume the urgent process of rebuilding. This process demands money to turn the wheel of the economy. Regarding states which announced the presence of the money of corrupt Egyptian government officials in their banks, we await for them to present to Egypt loans and temporary aid—with the frozen assets as collateral—until the end of the trial and the return of the stolen money.,,We assert that the states which put forward such aid free of goals of interference in Egyptian politics will enjoy the greatest appreciation of the revolutionary forces and the Egyptian people and army, which will be reflected upon Egypt’s relations and political stances towards those states in the future.,,3) The forces of the Egyptian revolution have now turned to reconstruction and monitoring the role of the state apparati. This is reflected upon the state of security in the country. Subsequently we demand that friendly countries remove travel warnings or bans for their tourists who wish to visit Egypt and encourage them to spend their holidays in our country to give a push to touristic development and to help cross the economic crisis as a kind of commendable effort on the part of friendly countries. We will appreciate their help in this regard.,,4) The million-person demonstrations on Fridays are not just to remind the government that the revolution remains in progress, but to give a clear, an extraordinarily clear message to the entire world that what happened in our country is not an uprising of the youth but rather a true popular revolution which will not end until it realizes its goals.,,The demonstrations will support the government’s position (domestic and abroad), and thus make counter-revolutionary forces (at home and abroad) remain in their lairs afraid of the people’s intrepidness against them. The million-person demonstrations are an entirely healthy phenomenon which must continue and develop to realize the aims of the revolution and to protect the home front as well as abroad from the mettling of antagonistic forces (counter-revolutionary and reactionary).,,Forward, Egypt! Awake, Egypt! You shall never fall!,,Together we complete our revolution for the sake of a better tomorrow.,","Logistics, Military, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144636im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Popular-Revolution-Statement-1-1.png,imgID131,

A Letter from Shaykh Ahmad Sa’id,2011-05-16,2011,"You are great, oh Egypt!,Safety and security are sweeter than eating pomegranates![1],Oh sons of protected Egypt, say: “Praise be to God whose throne is in heaven and who has authority on Earth, and pray often for the best of mankind [Muhammad] to gain favor from the Merciful.”,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, do not forget the saying of al-’Adnan: “Whenever people hate the poor, lay bare the world’s structure, and rush in to gather all of the wealth, then God curses them with four traits; drought from time, oppression from the ruler, betrayal from the ruling powers and injuries from enemies.” All of these are the results of the Merciful’s anger.,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, tell the youth of Egypt the precious, from Giza and al-Ma’adi to the Delta, in every street and neighborhood, Muslims and Christians: “You made legitimate demands that require patience, deliberation and the Merciful’s protection.”,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, tell the youth of Egypt the precious: “How I wish we could turn the wheel of production, so that we don’t become poor or needy. How I wish we could stand hand in hand with our government, and give them all our trust, for the sake of our country’s rebirth, that the merits of the religion of the Merciful might appear.”,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, it is no shame for men to live under the rule of any leader, even if he is an enemy of the Merciful. It is, however, a disgrace to follow the ruler’s deviations and stray from the religion of the Merciful.,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, God’s prophet Yusuf was under the rule of the Egyptian King Akhenatun, and Mu’min was under the rule of the Pharaohs, but they were some of the best of the believers among God’s servants.,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, in every domain there are the righteous and the unjust, even in the houses of the Prophets. Why not speak more generally, for Joseph and Benjamin were among the beautiful people, and Simon and Levi were from the deficient people, but in the end they were all among the helpers of the prophet.,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, beware of the snake, for it is the world. In it lie both poison and antidote. There is benefit in its antidote and danger in its poison. Do not forget the word of God, may he be exalted: “Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds.” This is the meaning of mercy from the Merciful.,Oh sons of Egypt the protected, protect Egypt; if it is sick, treat it, but beware of the medicine.

This means an individual being just to himself, and then to those around him, until we become a just nation in every aspect of life; a nation that enthrones the individual’s role and respects it. On the path toward this, we have applied to officially establish the party, based on the work order which we presented to the General Field Marshal, Commander of the Armed Forces on February 14th, 2011, [document] number 74, at the office of personnel of the Defense Ministry, and we summarize it in what follows here:,,1. Confiscation of finances belonging to the corrupt, whatever their level, from the president down to the lowest official.,2.

The activation of the private investment sector to sincere national capitalism and the heads of foreign funds, and making a greater role for honest business in society in order to revive the Egyptian economy.,,PAGE 2,In the name of God the merciful and compassionate,The Justice Party (Under construction) ((our platform of justice is the basis of sovereignty)),For the Egyptian people ((The one who has his daily bread controls his decisions)),We are on the path toward that, by presenting this document to the Field Marshal with our demands for realizing social justice which is the basis for freedom and democracy which the January 25th revolution let flow. On condition that these demands are our foundational platform for the party we choose for president someone like Abu Bakr al-Siddiq; ministers like ‘Umar, ‘Uthman and ‘Ali; someone such as the Prophet Joseph (May peace be upon him) for the Ministry of Finance; men for the Ministry of Defense such as Khalid al-Qa’qa’ and Abu ‘Ubayda al-Jarrah; and counselors such as the disciples of Jesus (may peace be upon him).If we are not like them, then we should resemble them – Magdy Khazbak.,,What follows is the letters of our demands found at Civilian Affairs in the Ministry of Defense in Cairo under number 72 on 02/14/2011.,“ To: The Field Marshal and General Leader of the Armed Forces and leader of the revolution of modern Egypt, Hussein Tantawy, and the members of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces,Greetings,From a citizen from the land of Egypt, the land of Kinana, to your sovereignty as leaders of the transitional period for the safeguarded Egyptian revolution, we ask from you the following:,,First, The issuance of a statement proclaiming the confiscation of all possessions of the former president, of his relatives, and of the former workers of the state apparatus, which is established to be corrupt and corrupting.,,Second, clamping down with an iron fist on all those corrupt people who have stolen the Egyptian people’s possessions and wealth from their industrial and commercial and territory facilities, and sold them at the lowest price. We request from you the following, in order to realize these important steps:,,A) The issuance of a decree stating that it is incumbent upon all those who offered bribes or brokerage commissions and benefited from them to present to the protest committee a statement containing the names of all those who received bribes or brokerage commissions during the past month. This shall be carried out in order to determine the real cost of the purchase value of any asset purchased in accordance with the contracts made with the the former entity of the corrupt nation.,,B) Limiting all transactions of facilities, whether they be industrial, agricultural, commercial, territorial, or state-owned land for a consideration period of one month. This is granted to the buyers in order to clarify the real cost of all the former state’s suspicious transactions.,,C.) The formation of a committee, or group of committees comprised of people of known integrity to determine the current market price for all of these sales transactions. They will also determine the balances which must be remitted to the general treasury as a result of the sale of these assets.,In the case that the beneficiary is unable to pay the balance, the contract is to be considered null and void, and he will be reimbursed the purchase value in relation to the capital he has paid, the true value at the time of purchase and the current market value. This value will be determined based upon an open auction held in accordance with the working auction laws. Or, the beneficiary may enter into an offer with the state for the true value of his paid capital and to estimate its current value as a partner in the project if that project cannot be partitioned.,,2. [should be D] Setting the work period for these committees at no longer than six months from the time of this statement to complete their work.,,Third, The activation of the public sector’s role once it has been recovered from these suspicious transactions and placing it under the control of men known to be capable and honest to administer these projects. They should create appropriate work opportunities and reestablish the state’s control over the industrial and commercial sectors. The former regime of this state had lost control over its facilities most notably in the sectors of iron, cement, fertilizer, nourishment resources, and others. These are among those vital facilities which would give the state its prestige that it lost during the previous regime.,,Fourth, the selection of a council of ministers comprised of men known to be competent and to have integrity. They should be from among those who did not agree with the the old regime and did not march alongside it. There are many [qualified candidates] among Egypt’s loyal sons.,,Fifth, Investing all the state’s resources in establishing strong national industries of all types such manufacturing, commercial, and agricultural. This will amplify the nation’s resources, both human and material in order to spread prosperity throughout all of Egypt. So that poor citizens can sense the gains of the revolution through an increase in job opportunities and a raise in income. This so as to provide the basic needs of life for the citizens, coinciding with their income levels.,,Sixth, Putting in place, as a legal ruling, a minimum wage which makes it possible for citizens to lead honorable lives. Doubling unemployment pensions for all unemployed college graduates who have not been provided with work opportunities. This pension will be equivalent to half of the amount decided upon by the state for the minimum wage, so that the unemployed are also able to have a dignified life.,,Seventh, take economic steps to give relief to the Egyptian pound so that it can return to its market value with respect to foreign currencies. This can be accomplished through the following steps:,,1. Total cancellation of current money denominations on the market during a transitional period of 3 months; printing new money dated to the “January 2011 Revolution.” The bills should be nothing but green in color, so that the common citizen is able to distinguish it from the currency of the former regime. This currency, in its different denominations, will replace the former currency. This will be carried out with the condition that an upper-ceiling limit be set so that, for example, each Egyptian citizen could exchange a maximum of 1,000,000 pounds (LE). It would be obligatory for those who wish for an increase in this upper-limit to prepare a certificate from the general taxes agency specifying the amount which he would like to exchange in this new currency.,With this step, the liquidity of the Egyptian pound which has been funneled into markets, could be determined. It would put a halt to all suspicious financial practices which would now all be changed into the currency of the revolution. The accounting of these exchanges would be in accordance with the laws already in force as would the accounting the increases contained in the exchange rate from the old currency to the new.,,2. Fixing the price for vessel-passage through the Suez Canal in Egyptian pounds. In this way the exports of all merchandise would be in Egyptian pounds rather than in foreign currencies. This process would return the purchase-power of the Egyptian pound to what it was previously.,Eighth, the cancellation of all taxation imposed on individual persons who are unable to exchange the upper-limit of 1,000,000 pounds (LE) of the currency of the former regime into the currency of the revolution. This will occur after they present documentation indicating such an inability from the central bank which controls the printing and changing of money.,Ninth, the activation of the ombudsman’s role to allow justice to return to all quarters of Egypt.,,Tenth, Make a healthy parliamentary life for a free parliament to express all the enthusiasm and hopes of the citizens, by way of fair elections conducted by the National Identity card number. The cancellation of the elections lists of the old regime. Representatives from the judiciary, the United Nations and all foreign countries who so desire shall oversee them. The Egyptian people are not less than the American people who accepted Egypt’s regulatory role over its elections, this as a simplistic example of the electoral transparency in American elections since it is the strongest nation in the world. We, as a people with the first historical roots, deserve such an electoral process.,,Eleventh: Conducting presidential elections by the parliamentary electoral process to realize a civil society and to lay out its democratic rules.,,By these previous steps, Mr. Field Marshal, we have made a map for the January 25th Revolution. We have handed the nation over to a new democratic rule, and generations will speak of your honorable achievement in putting Egypt on the peaceful path toward democracy.,Twelfth: The humane treatment of persons with special needs in all governmental interests of the state and the private sector; granting them guaranteed legal privileges in governmental appointments, public housing, and specially-equipped vehicles at cost.,,Legal Accountant/ Magdy Muhammad Hassan Khazbak,East Balbays Port Said Road, next to Fardaws School.,Telephone: XXXXXXXXX,Mobile: XXXXXXXXX,Visit us on Facebook “Justice Party”– Email Magdy Khazbak,Eamil [sic]: XXXXXXXXX,","Politics, The Justice Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151947im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/JusticePartyFoundation-1.png,imgID139,
The People Want the Life of the Square,2011-05-13,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 6, Page 2],The People Want the Life of the Square,While the world talked about the Egyptian revolution, considering it to be a rare example of people’s revolutions, it was not just about the revolution’s success in overthrowing the head of the regime – for how many presidents of various regimes have been overthrown in revolutions, coups, and foreign and regional meddling? However, the inspiring thing in the Egyptian revolution and at the heart of the Tunisian revolution was the unity and coalescence of the people over days and weeks in a number of provinces, united by the clear and specific demand for the fall of the regime. Every difference and distinction that separated people before the revolution disappeared off to the side, and nothing remained except one difference: the distinction between the conquerors and the conquered, between the oppressors and the oppressed, and between the governors and the governed. Differences disappeared in the struggle and in the process and preparations for sacrifice for the sake of freedom, justice, and respect between men and women, between Copts and Muslims, and even between the young and the old. Everyone rallied around the one demand, around a dream of one free country, until the people were truly living and enjoying their dignity, proud of their affiliation with this country and their combined ability to liberate it from the hands of those who governed it with iron and fire, stealing and plundering its wealth for dozens of years. The head of the regime fell and the revolutionaries started to check off demand after demand that the revolution had raised. Mubarak fell and the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council were dissolved. These were two examples of the regime’s tyranny with their counterfeiting, looting, and the intermarriage of politics and finance in order to hoard an excess of money as well as practicing politics for the benefits of the minority at the expense of the majority. Then, as the government of Shafiq fell based on the demands of the revolutionaries, matters began to take another direction. Constitutional changes were declared, more of them from the old constitution of 1977 than from the demands of the revolutionaries, such as military courts for the people but investigations by ordinary courts for the head and other symbols of the regime, along with excepting some of these from court without explanation. One attempt after another was made to dispel the revolutionaries from the streets, ending in the violent dispersion of Tahrir Square that resulted in the deaths of at least three people, the injuries of dozens, the imprisonment of many, and their trial in military courts under the claim that they were thugs. At this time, the revolutionaries, the army, and the government of ‘Isam Sharaf are not the only sides on the playing field. We do not know the source of the counter-revolution that began violently harassing the women’s march on their holiday, as though women had not come to join the revolution family and as though there were not women among the martyrs who paid the price of their lives for the victory of the revolution. Thus, the spirit of brotherhood and unity between women and men disappeared. We do not know how sectarianism reared its ugly face once again to burn the church of Atfih and preoccupy the people once more with questions regarding Copts having equal citizenship with Muslims. The spirit of fraternization and the shared goal disappeared, and the discourse became about what differentiates the two sides from each other and not about what gathered them together. We do not know how the demands of the Egyptian workers, who, when they began the strike against their companies on February 9th,caused the regime to realize that maintaining Hosni Mubarak had become extremely costly, became “sectarian demands”. The revolutionary agenda, which was not undertaken for any reason other than to achieve social justice, freedom, dignity, and humanity, has no room for them. We do not know how the youths of the lower social classes that stood in the front lines to confront the bullets and defend the revolutionaries during the Battle of the Camel, sacrificing their lives for the revolution, changed into ‘thugs’ who must be pursued and tried under military tribunals. We do not know how businessmen appeared, condemning the revolution, attacking and accusing it of every possible allegation, only to become spokesmen at the forefront of news and institutions for parties that demand massive amounts of capital for their establishment. It is as though the parties are monopolized by whomever has money…,Where did the spirit of the square go? How was the revolution stolen in this way? How did we allow the media and the megaphones of the regime to broadcast the spirit of separation and sedition between those who were just yesterday standing close together in one line in front of a common enemy in Tahrir Square and the rest of the squares in Egypt?,Before January 25, matters were clear… we knew what we wanted and what the obstacles in front of us blocking our way were, and we knew what we must do to remove them. Today it appears that matters are less clear. One of the reasons for this could be the feelings of fatigue and the desire to harvest the fruits of the revolution. But an early harvest reaps nothing other than bitter fruits. Our revolution is still at the beginning, and many of the demands of the revolution are still waiting to be achieved. Their achievement requires the unity that gathered us in the square. The mighty forces of the counter-revolution, which take a new form every day like a chameleon, are on the lookout for this unity. Let the spirit of the square, the demands of the square, and the unity of the square be our compass. Let us remember that more than 1,000 martyrs did not die for any reason other than the victory of this revolution. The least we can do for them is repay this debt.,,",Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164714im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/thawrya6.png,imgID140,
Election of Governors is a Popular Demand that Must be Achieved,2011-05-13,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 6, Page 1],Election of Governors is a Popular Demand that Must be Achieved,The latest governors’ movement came via the “Sharaf” government mediation which calls itself “the revolution” government. This movement disappointed hopes as well as shocked and destroyed the most important demand of the revolution, which was to demand the eradication of corruption from the bottom up, including changing twenty-two governors. All of these were favorites of the past regime and suspicions of corruption, taking advantage of influence, and profiteering follow them. Their distribution is as follows: 5 men from the National Democratic Party, 9 army generals, and 8 from the Ministry of the Interior. The movement of the new governors appears to be a reward to men of the past era for their efforts in corrupting political life, wasting public money while holding their previous offices, and establishing principles of oppression, tyranny, and inequality.,In the two governorates of Alexandria and Bani Suwayf, the designation of Mahir al-Dumiati as governor of Bani Suwayf came not more than a month after his dismissal (at the hand of the Military Council) from his position as president of Zagazig University. This came after protests against him increased, as it is known that he is one of the university presidents who most pardoned and helped security forces with extensive meddling in university affairs, faculty members’ promotions, and student elections, not to mention the thugs he permitted to enter the university campus. The same thing recurred in the Alexandrian governorate with the choice of ‘Isam Salim, former president of Alexandria University, known for his suspicious meddling in the elections of the Faculty Members’ Club in the interests of the National Democratic Party and rigging student union elections in the university to extend the length of his presidency.,As for the new governors coming from the Ministry of the Interior, this occurred a lot, as General Samir Salam was rewarded by being appointed as governor to the al-Minya governorate after he was governor in al-Daqahliyya. His concern with gratifying the security apparatus was well known, as well as the illegal finance charges and compulsory donations he imposed, so much so that he bragged in a meeting that he spent 72 million on local services from the 120 million Egyptian pounds he gathered from these compulsory donations. Meanwhile, the province of al-Daqahliyya suffers from unprecedented deterioration in all services. Regarding General Ibrahim Hamad, Public Relations Assistant to the Minister of the Interior, he was appointed to the Asyut governorate, and suspicions of financial corruption follow him. He was one of the biggest supporters of former minister Habib al-‘Adali, as he described the era of al-‘Adali as among the best eras for financial internal discipline. The same thing occurred in the al-Daqahliyya governorate, where the choice fell on General Muhsin Hafzi, Director of Giza Security and Assistant to the former Minister of the Interior.,Considering the appointment of army generals as governors, this is a complete denial of what the Military Council promised as far as withdrawing from political life and returning to its barracks once more. The new structure of the governorates ensures that things will remain as they previously were—as if nothing has happened… as if the revolution came to overthrow Mubarak and the senior leaders in his regime while maintaining the rules of the corrupt system as it was without any change. The revolution demanded that state affairs be administered civilly. This demand will not be achieved as long as positions in the governorates are appointed by the Cabinet. Choosing governors by way of elections is a popular demand on which there can be no compromise because it is the guaranteed way to implement the civil state for which we are striving. In such a state, the electoral choice shall be for the best candidate and not the one closest to the security agencies and the army.,,",Politics,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165106im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/thawrya6.png,imgID141,
Popular Control Over Municipal Law,2011-05-13,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 6, Page 1],Popular Control Over Municipal Law,“Power to the People”,When Zakaria ‘Azmi, Chief of Staff in the corrupt regime, described the municipalities a number of years ago, he said that “we are up to our ears in corruption”, although it is certain that corruption in the municipalities rose to the extent that it covered heads as well. So the question is: why did the municipalities become a source of corruption?,What is meant by municipalities are the local People’s Councils and their presence in city centers, neighborhoods, and villages, pursuant to statute number 43 issued in 1979 concerning local administration and regulation.,These assemblies, along with the governorates, assumed the establishment and administration of all public utilities located under their jurisdiction within the limits of public policy and the general plan for the state. They are therefore important in the daily life of all citizens in Egypt’s neighborhoods and villages, reflected in public services such as education, health services, sewerage, and the ability to target the poor in social programs, as well as in areas such as sanitation and traffic regulation. All of these are among the provisions that are supposed to be offered by the municipalities, about which experts are united in saying there is a complete deterioration in the performance of these services.,With the absence of any semblance of the people’s supervision over municipalities, corruption and bribery ran rampant, and basic services were withdrawn from citizens. The municipalities even validated the thuggery and sins of the National Democratic Party.,The fall of local administrative law and the preparation of new revolutionary law for the current administration became necessary after the revolution. The legal articles were derived from the period after the people’s revolution, and it was enough that two laws were made to serve the interests of conscienceless National Democratic Party members. The local growth strategy in the coming phase must rely on the central role of the people to support the basic structure and administrative projects in the correct way through the participation of the People’s Assembly in policy development and prioritizing project spending, particularly considering that the people are the source of legislation and supervision. This will be done in a decentralized way, for decentralization is the key to democracy—the same way in which the developed world is heading.,All revolutionaries must work with “The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution” in order to disband the current corrupt councils, to abolish the old law of the local administration with all of its loopholes, and make a new revolutionary law that ensures transparency, decentralization, and supervision by the people.,If the People’s Assembly assumes a supervisory role, this will be the most important core of its work, for its role in popular supervision over the elected Local Councils will be among its most important missions in the coming period. This will begin with offering suggestions for new municipal laws, pushing for honorable candidates, and monitoring the integrity and follow-up of elections.

These were two examples of the regime’s tyranny with their counterfeiting, looting, and the intermarriage of politics and finance in order to hoard an excess of money as well as practicing politics for the benefits of the minority at the expense of the majority. Then, as the government of Shafiq fell based on the demands of the revolutionaries, matters began to take another direction. Constitutional changes were declared, more of them from the old constitution of 1977 than from the demands of the revolutionaries, such as military courts for the people but investigations by ordinary courts for the head and other symbols of the regime, along with excepting some of these from court without explanation. One attempt after another was made to dispel the revolutionaries from the streets, ending in the violent dispersion of Tahrir Square that resulted in the deaths of at least three people, the injuries of dozens, the imprisonment of many, and their trial in military courts under the claim that they were thugs. At this time, the revolutionaries, the army, and the government of ‘Isam Sharaf are not the only sides on the playing field. We do not know the source of the counter-revolution that began violently harassing the women’s march on their holiday, as though women had not come to join the revolution family and as though there were not women among the martyrs who paid the price of their lives for the victory of the revolution. Thus, the spirit of brotherhood and unity between women and men disappeared. We do not know how sectarianism reared its ugly face once again to burn the church of Atfih and preoccupy the people once more with questions regarding Copts having equal citizenship with Muslims. The spirit of fraternization and the shared goal disappeared, and the discourse became about what differentiates the two sides from each other and not about what gathered them together. We do not know how the demands of the Egyptian workers, who, when they began the strike against their companies on February 9th,caused the regime to realize that maintaining Hosni Mubarak had become extremely costly, became “sectarian demands”. The revolutionary agenda, which was not undertaken for any reason other than to achieve social justice, freedom, dignity, and humanity, has no room for them. We do not know how the youths of the lower social classes that stood in the front lines to confront the bullets and defend the revolutionaries during the Battle of the Camel, sacrificing their lives for the revolution, changed into ‘thugs’ who must be pursued and tried under military tribunals. We do not know how businessmen appeared, condemning the revolution, attacking and accusing it of every possible allegation, only to become spokesmen at the forefront of news and institutions for parties that demand massive amounts of capital for their establishment. It is as though the parties are monopolized by whomever has money…,Where did the spirit of the square go? How was the revolution stolen in this way? How did we allow the media and the megaphones of the regime to broadcast the spirit of separation and sedition between those who were just yesterday standing close together in one line in front of a common enemy in Tahrir Square and the rest of the squares in Egypt?,Before January 25, matters were clear… we knew what we wanted and what the obstacles in front of us blocking our way were, and we knew what we must do to remove them. Today it appears that matters are less clear. One of the reasons for this could be the feelings of fatigue and the desire to harvest the fruits of the revolution. But an early harvest reaps nothing other than bitter fruits. Our revolution is still at the beginning, and many of the demands of the revolution are still waiting to be achieved. Their achievement requires the unity that gathered us in the square. The mighty forces of the counter-revolution, which take a new form every day like a chameleon, are on the lookout for this unity. Let the spirit of the square, the demands of the square, and the unity of the square be our compass. Let us remember that more than 1,000 martyrs did not die for any reason other than the victory of this revolution. The least we can do for them is repay this debt.,Revolution until victory,Central telephone: [phone # redacted],Blog: http://leganthawrya.blogspot.com,Facebook: The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Egyptian Revolution,Email: leganthawrya@yahoo.com,","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144843im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/thawrya6.png,imgID143,
The Tahrir Generation Party,2011-05-12,2011,"The Tahrir Generation Party,,The idea to found Tahrir Generation Party came as a way to build support for the January 25th Revolution, which sacrificed the souls of many Egyptian youths as martyrs of liberation.

What if we Choose Islam?,2011-05-11,2011,",WHAT IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM?,[Gray box top left of document],Thanks be to God and peace and prayers be upon God’s Prophet, May God bless him and grant him peace, and his family, companions, and those who have succeeded him:,The West and its hypocritical lackeys have tried to intimidate people away from Islam, to spread what they call “Islamophobia,” to distance people from this great religion. Accordingly, many people might buy into fearing Islam. This is the case since they think that peoples choosing Islam and applying the law of God, may He be exalted, is tantamount to cutting off hands and restricting freedoms. They have simply conflated Islam with applying capital punishment. They believe that the choice for Islam is a step backwards for the Muslims, and a return to the gloomy Middle Ages. They have filled the people’s hearts with horror. This view is narrow-minded, and does not do justice to Islam. In light of this, with my words here I want to clarify for you, my friends, and indeed for everyone–just what is Islam?!!,[End grey box],My honorable brothers: When the revolution took place in our country, I looked at the slogans that the youth and others raised, most of which were: justice–security—combating corruption—equality—economic reform—freedom— and they ranged to many other great and true slogans besides these. When I examined them, I saw that all these slogans are from the great qualities that Islam, that is, our religion, calls for and urges.,Indeed, my brother, don’t be surprised by this. The bases for political reform in Islam are “Counsel—Justice—Freedom—Equality.” This, by God, is Islam…This is God’s law and His path…This is God’s religion.,So, if we choose Islam, these demands would be realized; nay, to go much further even, it would teach Muslims…indeed, it would even teach the world that the first of the many fruits of adherence to Islam is global reform. They would learn that the first of many fruits of judging by God’s law is an honorable, natural life. Thus, what if we choose Islam?,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN WE WILL ACHIEVE THE JUSTICE WE WANT..,Indeed, it is justice which makes the nation’s president equal to the least of men. It makes a nation in which each individual has rights and duties for which he is responsible.,“No” to using the throne and high post to oppress the subjects. In our religion, our Lord—may He be blessed and exalted– in the divine hadith, said: “O my servants, I have forbidden oppression for myself and have made it forbidden among you, so do not oppress one another.”,Do you know, my dear brother, that if we choose Islam, then it would be within anyone’s right to go to an official of Parliament, or to any governmental authority, and demand what he needs from this official. No one would have the right to prevent this. This is perfect justice. Reflect on the Prophet’s hadith, may God bless him and grant him peace: “If someone takes a position of leadership for Muslims and overlooks their wants, their needs, their poverty, or their destitution, the God will overlook his wants, his needs, and his destitution on the Day of Judgment.” Praise be to God! This is the justice of Islam.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN EQUALITY WILL BE ACHIEVED,between the ruler and the ruled, the honorable and the lowly, the rich and the poor. We will not find nepotism, nor favoritism, nor flattery, for all of us are equal. The foundations for equality were laid down by our Prophet, May God bless him and grant him peace. A woman from Ibn Makhzum’s tribe had stolen something. Usama ibn Zayd, May God be pleased with him who was the beloved of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, came to him. He interceded with the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, asking the Prophet not to punish her. Usama ibn Zayd was surprised with the Prophet’s rejection, may God bless him and grant him peace: “Are you interceding in God’s affairs, Usama! By God, if Fatima, Muhammad’s daughter, stole, Mohammad would cut off her hand.” This is Islam. It is sufficient.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THERE WILL BE NO DICTATORSHIP NOR EXPLOITATION OF POWER, NOR INDIVIDUAL DESPOTISM..,But rather soft counsel, mercy, and kindness, for Islam is a religion of true counsel. Reflect on the words of God, may He be exalted, to His prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace: “It was through God’s Mercy that you were lenient with them. Had you been severe and hard-hearted, they would have broken away from around you; forgive them and ask forgiveness for them. Take counsel with them about this affair” [Surat Al ‘Imran, verse 159]. Hence, it was the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, who consulted his companions, may God be pleased with them, as for what to do with the prisoners of Badr, and he took their advice. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, even consulted his wife Umm Salama, may God be pleased with her, on the day of the al-Hudaybiyyah treaty, and implemented her advice.,Most scholars agree that the ruler needs to consult experts and specialists in regards to discretionary matters.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN GOD WILL REFORM THE ECONOMY, AND GOD WILL REWARD THE WEALTHY MAN WHO IS HONORABLE TOWARDS HIS SERVANTS,Islam forbids wasting money and urges defending it. Indeed “whoever dies without his money is a martyr” as it says in the hadith. Likewise, Islam combats usury and consuming people’s money in vain. God, may He be exalted, has threatened whomever deals in usury when He said: “If you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger but if you repent, you will have your principal. Do not treat others unjustly and they will not treat you unjustly” [Surat al-Baqara, verse 279]. The best European economic specialists have said “We need to strictly apply Islamic economics to get out of the global economic crisis, so let us lower the interest to 0%.”–This is a respectable loan—“and let’s impose a tax on the rich of 2-3%” This is the alms-tax in Islam.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM.. THE QUALITY OF LIVING WILL INCREASE, AND GOD’S INDESCRIBABLE GRACE WILL BLESS US,As God almighty has said: “Had the people of the towns believed and been God-fearing, we would have opened for them blessings from heaven and earth. They had been lying, however, so we took from them what they had amassed” [Surat al-A’raf, verse 96]; “Had they observed the Torah, the Gospel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have eaten what was above them and what was underneath their feet” [Surat al-Ma’ida, verse 66]; “If they were to go on the straight path, we would have given them water in abundance” [Surat al-Jinn, verse 16]; “I said: ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord. He is Forgiving. ‘He will send rain to you in torrents, support you with wealth and children, grant you gardens. and grant you rivers.’” [Surat al-Nuh, verses 10-12]. These are the blessings of God which, in the era of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, made a kernel of wheat as big as a date pit. He had written on it: “This was what would grow during the time of justice”.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM.. THEN CORRUPTION WILL STOP, AND WE WILL SEIZE OUR RIGHTS FROM THE CORRUPT,because Islam imposes capital punishments for theft, if it was done by those who harm and kill or those who have corrupted the land and have oppressed others, as it says in word of God, may he be exalted: “The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger or cause mischief in the land is that they will be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on alternate sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and in the next world they will have a terrible punishment” [Surat al-Ma’ida, verse 33]. At that time the wealth of Egypt will be returned to its needy, downcast people. Salaries and incomes will increase.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM.. THEN WE WILL ATTAIN FREEDOM,Yes, all of you who want freedom, it is indeed found in Islam. Islam says that: “Since when do you enslave people even though their mothers gave birth to them as free people? You shall not be a slave to money, nor to a wife, nor to a president, nor an officer.. you will be liberated from all of this and you will be a servant to one only, God, the Great and Almighty. This is total freedom.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM.. OUR HEARTS, STREETS, AND PUBLIC SQUARES WILL ALL BE CLEANED, AND OUR PATHS TO GOD LEVELED.,For, Islam is what teaches you to take an honest wage for clearing damaging things from the path to God. Indeed, a man entered paradise for removing a forking branch from the people’s path. In fact, a ruler should worry that if he does not pave paths for his people, or even for livestock, then God will ask him why the path was not fixed for them, as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, May God be pleased with him, said.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM.. WE WILL OBTAIN SOCIETAL GUARANTEES,The alms tax, a cornerstone of Islam, is taken from the rich. Unlike the oppressive taxes of today, it does not go into the pockets of state officials but rather it goes back to the poor. This ensures that money will not be monopolized by the rich. The door of charity is wide-open. Islam wants donations of any size, even as insignificant as a date pit. Islam calls for sponsoring orphans, and whoever adopts an orphan will be the Prophet’s companion, may God bless him and grant him peace, in paradise. Islam says: Whoever has excess should give it to those who do not.”,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN OUR HOMES WILL BE REFORMED AND THE FAMILY BROUGHT UPRIGHT,The son will honor his father dutifully, and the father shall care for his son dutifully. Through Islam one retains one’s dignity and does not smear it with adultery. Through Islam one is happy in marriage, and the door of the forbidden is closed.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..ALL DETAILS OF LIFE WILL BE ORDERED.,Indeed, details both small and large. Our lord said: “We have sent down to you the Book as an explanation of everything” [Surat al-Nahl, verse 89].,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..ALL OF SOCIETY WILL BE REFORMED.,A man will feed his neighbor since this grants him a reward. A homeowner will honor his guest because there is faith and virtue in this. Indeed a strange traveler will be happy eating and drinking so that he becomes satisfied, since he has a right in Islam.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN OUR MORALS WILL BE RETURNED TO US, WHICH THE EAST AND WEST HAVE STOLEN,from us, for there are no lies in Islam, rather truth and wholeness comes from it. There is no obscenity nor libel in Islam..rather, there is communication and charity. There is no fleeing responsibility…rather there is integrity and soundness in actions.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN WE WILL BECOME THE LEARNED ONES OF THE WORLD,just as we used to be. Progress and civilization will spread since the first word mentioned in Islam is “Read.” Indeed, it is knowledge, upon which the call to Islam is based.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN ALL WILL BE HAPPY, EVEN ANIMALS,There is no “Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals” in our society, because that is our religion itself, in which God commands kindness toward animals: give a dog to drink and you will enter paradise. Show a cat mercy and give him a bite to eat and your sins will be forgiven.”,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN WE WILL OBTAIN HARMONY BETWEEN BODY AND SOUL; BETWEEN THIS WORLD, AND OUR RELIGION.,For our Islam commands us: “You belong to your lord”—and at the same time—“You belong to your body and your family, and you belong to your guest”.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..WE WILL OBTAIN SECURITY, MAKING US AND OTHERS SAFE,We will take the hand of those who have strayed from the path and the hand of criminals. Preserving one’s soul, property, money, and religion is among the fundamental goals of Islam.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN THERE WILL BE SECURITY FOR CHRISTIANS FOR THEMSELVES, THEIR FINANCES, THEIR PLACES LIVING, AND EVEN THEIR CHURCHES.,For, whoever harms them while they are in our lands, we will wage war against them. This goes along with our beliefs that “you have your religion, and I have mine” and “there is no compulsion in religion.” Recall that Islam’s prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever breaks a pact shall never smell the fragrance of paradise”,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..WE WILL NOT VIOLATE A PACT OR A TREATY..NOT EVEN WITH THE JEWS,Otherwise, when we violate these pacts or treaties with them, God says: Except those of the polytheists with whom you have a treaty, and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfill their treaty to them for the end of their term. Surely Allah loves the pious [Surat al-Tuba, verse 4]. Piety to God is our upholding our treaties with them and others.,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN WE WILL EXERT OURSELVES ALONG THE PATH TO GOD,“No” to bloody predispositions, but instead, the path to stopping bloodshed, reclaiming our rights, opening the doors of preaching, and responding to injustice. Whoever is surprised that when we capture a prisoner of war who wanted to kill us, we treat him well and feed him, he should know that it is because our Lord has said : “Out of love for him they give food to poor, the orphans, and the captives” [Surat al-Insan, verse 8].,IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..THEN WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY.,Their legacy is protected, and no one would violate this except an oppressor. Her honor and dignity would be maintained. Whoever slanders women is to be whipped eighty lashes. A woman has no obligation to support anyone, but rather someone should support her. Her share is equal to that of a man, as is well known: “A woman’s share is the same as that of a man.” The best person is the one who treats women well: “The best of you, the best of you should marry their women.”,..IF WE CHOOSE ISLAM..,Then we will communicate with God through the five daily prayers, without tiring, for who is unable to pray unless he is asleep?,We will sympathize with the poor, so we will fast…and he who falls ill will be prepared for other days.,We will go on pilgrimage on the Hajj. Anyone unable to do so is not required to go.,There is no burden in these obligations, nor difficulty. If this were not the case, it would not be required:“What religion causes you in terms of difficulty” and “God wants ease for you, not hardship.”,Finally, I say that nothing will reform this nation except the religion of God, may He be blessed and praised.,Nothing else will reform this nation unless it does what Islam would do. Believing in Islam and applying God’s law are neither extraneous nor desired, but rather it is an inevitable, obligatory imposition. God, may He be exalted, has said: “There is no God but God.” Likewise He said: “There is no judgment except by God.”,So we ask God, may He be exalted, to endear the nation to His law, May His Qur’an and the Sunna of His Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, be made our laws. We ask Him to guide us properly towards Him. We ask Him to appoint the best of us as our leaders and to not appoint the worst. We ask Him to reform our religion and our world, along with the shepherd and flock. This He has commanded. He is the greatest Ruler and the best Helper.,May God reward he who helps to spread Islam in speech, in print, and through signs.,FOR CHARITABLE DISTRIBUTION TO INDIVIDUALS AND BOOKSTORES, PLACE A REQUEST WITH “HOUSE OF ISLAM” (MEANS OF ADVOCACY, BROCHURES, BOOKS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS) THE PRICE OF PAPER IS AT 5 PIASTERS [phone number redacted]-[phone number redacted],To contact us via the Internet, go to the site “I am a Salafi” (www.anasalfy.com).,Please redistribute this when you have finished reading it in order to spread its benefit.

Final Communiqué of the Shura Council of the Society of Muslim Brothers,2011-05-10,2011,"Final Communiqué of the Shura Council of the Society of Muslim Brothers,Held in the Second Session of the Four Year Period 2010-2014AD,,The Shura Council of the Society of Muslim Brothers convened in an atmosphere of brotherhood, love, and a prevailing sentiment praising God for His blessing and bounty, during the Friday and Saturday 26th/27th of Jumada I, corresponding to the 29th/30th of April 2011 at the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo. His Eminence the General Guide spoke, stressing that the nation needs all the efforts of its sons and he urged the Society of Muslim Brothers in every office and department to hasten to implement what they can of the studies, so that they may be a model for others, and to present the rest of the studies to the Council of Ministers. He also appealed to all national forces and scientific institutions to contribute positively for the sake of reforming the state and raising the level of citizens in every field. He referred to the initiative which he previously presented to the national forces in the hope that they would agree upon it for the interest of Egypt.,He also praised the revolution of the blessed Egyptian people which changed the face of Egypt and urged the safeguarding of its vitality and momentum and the preservation of its goals until Egypt assumes its rightful place. He also hailed the souls of the martyrs who gave their lives on behalf of God and His religion for the sake of liberating the nation and asked God, on their behalf, to house them in the highest levels of Paradise, to bless their families with patience and fortitude, and to compensate them well.,He lauded the role of the armed forces in preserving the revolution and the state and for being keen on the rapid transfer of authority to the people by way of free and fair elections, and pointed out the necessity of preserving the cohesion, unity, and strength of the Armed Forces.,He also commended the government’s decision to open the Rafah crossing, its contribution to the Palestinian national interest, and the revival of national interest in the Palestinian issue by all Arabs and Muslims.,The Council discussed the issues before it and decided the following:,That each of them will leave their responsibilities in the Guidance Office.,And three alternates:,,Mr.-Dr. Mahmud Husayn,Secretary General for the Society of Muslim Brothers,","Politics, The Muslim Brotherhood",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151823im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Ikhwan-1.png,imgID146,

"Until Victory, No. 1: Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance, Foundation Issue",2011-05-08,2011,",Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance,,From here the beginning ran,And of the people, the new story began,In eighteen days the regime of a tyrant was overthrown. It was a people’s revolution which culminated in long-awaited freedom. Let the the responsibility of participation remain a “duty” for every Egyptian.,A blessed revolution erupted, and the blood of virtuous men was shed for the sake of dignity. Negativity and indifference now, however, will cause the souls of those martyrs, who gave their lives for the sake of honor, to have been sacrificed in vain.,For decades, Egypt remained without a spirit of partisanship able to draw the features of tomorrow. This led to a reluctance to participate and strive to make a difference. We have decided to reach out to you out of our belief and yours that tomorrow can be different from today.,Perhaps you have perused one of our pamphlets and found our ideas acceptable but simply do not know how to reach us. This is what motivated us to seek you out, in order to answer any questions or queries that may cross your mind. Join us in our weekly meeting, dedicated to getting to know one another, every Wednesday at 5:30.,The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance: # 2 Husayn al-Mi‘mar Street, which branches off of Mahmud Basiyuni, Tal‘at Harb Square.,To contact us please follow our page on Facebook:,HYPERLINK http://www.facebook.com/popular.alliance.party,,Or call the following number: [phone # redacted],,[Page 2:],,,“Change… Freedom… Social Justice” Slogans raised by the revolution of which their realization demands a struggle for change.,,The revolution has opened the doors of hope once again in Egypt; hope that each one of us may have a role in drawing the path of this country, hope for a better life as expressed by one of the slogans of the revolution: “Change, Freedom, Social Justice.” This was where the idea was born for founding the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance, which adopts the slogan of social and economic change alongside democratic change.,Indeed, hand in hand with the party’s insistence upon completing the path of transformation towards a full democracy is its belief that the fight for change in social and economic policies is no less important than the fight for democracy. It is unreasonable that 40% of Egypt’s population lives below the poverty line while a limited few possess enormous wealth. It is unreasonable that, every year, billions are being spent to build luxurious real estate and tourist resorts while we suffer from a housing crisis for those with low and moderate income. It is unreasonable that the state leaves millions of those who work in Egypt for wages without protection of their benefits and rights. For this reason, the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance defends the drafting of new policies for growth, which will primarily benefit the poor of this country as they are in the majority.,In the beginning, the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance was founded by the initiative of a group of leftists and socialists who believed that the Egyptian revolution came as a result of the absence of democracy as well as deep-rooted feelings of social injustice among the people. They also believed that the time was ripe to suggest the demand for social change hand-in-hand with democratic change.,The party began its activity in a preparatory conference held in the Trade Union Theater four weeks ago. At the conference, a foundational declaration was released which could be considered both a document of the party’s general principles and an internal list organizing its work during its period of foundation. This foundation period should last for three months and end in a foundational conference after which the party will become publicly announced and in official standing. The party’s temporary work has been divided between five primary committees, which are as follows:,,Party members also took the initiative to form three more committees, which are:,,The party is also currently arranging meetings in different provinces to meet with party membership in various regions and to introduce the party’s activities and general ideas to new members and those who want to join.,,We invite you to join and fight with us to complete the process of change in Egypt.,,,,Looted Funds from Mubarak’s “Poorhouse”,,It is difficult for any single expert to estimate the extent of corruption in the thirty years of Mubarak’s rule. This is due on the one hand to the numerous and divergent means of corruption, and on the other, to the regime demanding that many kinds of expenditures be covered up. Nevertheless, it is possible to point to some indicative figures, such as the fact that last year, wasteful spending reached 12 billion Egyptian pounds. On the other hand, the amount of public reserves, which has wavered between 10 and 16 billion Egyptian pounds in past years, is supposed to be spent in case of crises or natural disasters, whereas instead, most of these funds are spent on security forces and bonuses for senior Interior Ministry officials. In the health sector, wasted funds account for more than 300 million Egyptian pounds every year, while approximately 120 million pounds are wasted in the Ministry of Culture alone. Yet another 400 million pounds are transferred from Suez Canal revenues to the pockets of the presidency on a yearly basis. The amount of waste resulting from exporting gas to Israel at a cost less than global market prices is 9 billion pounds. The balances of special funds existing outside of the budget reach 1.273 trillion pounds, or 446% of the total general budget for the state, and those funds are spent far from the supervision of the People’s Assembly.,,On the other hand, there are other forms of corruption regarding the budget besides wasteful spending. For example, the percentage of the total budget spent on security is more than that spent on education, which means that the state spends more on the forces of oppression that keep the regime in place than it spends on the education of its people.,,Besides corruption in spending, there has been vast corruption involved in the process of privatization. This corruption has come in the form of billions lost in shady deals, in which assets owned by the people have been sold for much less than their true value. Such was the case of Al-Nasr Boiler Company, which sold for 15.6 million pounds when the actual value of its real estate alone (31 acres right on the banks of the Nile) had reached 300 million pounds. Furthermore, the salaries of those who run government media represent yet another face of corruption. For example, whereas most of the employees in the institution are paid no more than a few hundred pounds per month, the former executive council president of Al-Ahram used to earn two million, and other senior officials in the Egyptian Radio and Television Union receive similar paychecks.,,In light of just these few allusions, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the extent of corruption during Mubarak’s regime could be estimated at hundreds of billions of pounds. For this reason, it was not coincidental that the Mubarak regime did everything in its power to prevent the revolution’s success, just as it is not a coincidence that the post-revolution regime is risking its life in order to maintain the status quo. Nor is it by chance that the process of bringing the corrupt to trial is going extremely slowly, granting them the time they want to smuggle their funds out of the country. If Egyptians are being subject to military hearings that issue their verdicts in just a few days, would it not be rather more appropriate to expedite quick decision-making in order to retain the money of the corrupt, who have spent decades looting the people’s money?,,The “Parties Law” and the Secret Committee,,After more than a month and a half since Mubarak stepped down, and after repeated demands for the right to form publicly registered parties, unions, and associations, and just a few days after newspapers announced a legal decree would soon be announced that would fulfill these demands, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces issued instead a decree which disappointed all expectations.,,The law was drafted by an undisclosed committee, whose formation and composition is known by none, and this is not the only strange thing about it. It is a law whose drafters mastered the art of creating limits and conditions the likes of which you will not find in any place in the world that has political parties and elections.,,It contains elastic conditions such as that the party’s principles must not clash with the constitution, national security, national unity, or societal peace! There are also other more specific but unjustified conditions, such as that the party must not be established on the basis of class, sect, group, or geography, despite the fact that such parties exist in every part of the world that knows democracy.,,The law also discriminates between Egyptian citizens on the basis of race and sex, contained within strange conditions stipulating that anyone in a leadership role must have an Egyptian father.,,Five thousand members must sign their authorizations in the land registry, and their names must be published twice in two widespread newspapers, which costs more than a million Egyptian pounds. In other words, founding a party is the right of the rich only.,,Lastly, the Party Committee remains functional in legal form, and has the right to oppose the formation of any party. With such opposition, we enter the whirlwind of legal battle in court.,,The formation of a registered party means that any group of Egyptians has the right to establish a party, given that it agrees upon its programs and goals, commits to not discriminating between Egyptian citizens on the basis of religion, sex, language, race, or belief, and does not use or call for violence. Only specialized courts will determine the outcome of any accusations with regards to this matter.,,However, these clear and simple principles do not please those who secretly tailor laws for the military council.,[Page 3:],The Square, My Love,,I found her… that face I used to see during my childhood… those two pure-black eyes that contain all the meanings of life, among them anger, longing, and revolution… that face that carries within its features the meaning of genius.,,I found her… while I was walking through the Square, amongst waves of people who were angry but determined to overcome even fragments of rocks coming between them and their goal… While I had been looking into the depths of my soul, at that moment I found her, between the moment of happiness when I realized I was part of these waves and the moments of weakness and brokenness caused by the ruin that was my life.,,I found her gazing at me with that look of love I had cast upon her so many times as a child, though she would deliberately turn her gaze away from me. But today I see her gazing at me, and her gaze contains me. And I find that these gazes have cleansed my soul of all the ruin. I have contained all of this clamor standing inside, and those waves have become my very constitution.,,She came closer, and I was dumbstruck by how beautiful she was that day. The wounds I used to see in her face had disappeared, along with all of her wrinkles. All I could see was that radiant, lovely face and this look of love… She came even closer, passing amongst the ranks of people crowded into the Square with amazing ease, as though these crowds were a part of her. She stopped in front of me, smiling the smile of a lover who has finally found her soul. She bent her head, and I discovered that a tornado of feelings had engulfed us, separating us from all the clamor… She came very close to me and whispered, ‘Today I can say to you, ‘Yes, I love you,’”and she kissed my brow.,,I found that I had disappeared and become a part of her. Never before and never since have I felt such vigor as on that day. I looked at her face, which carries in its features green pastures and tired faces that today have discovered the path to victory. I took her two hands and felt that revolutionary warmth that had melted me inside of her. She whispered to me again: ‘Yes, I love you. Yes, you deserve this, because you saved me from drowning in the seas of death.’ And the sea in revolt crashed into me again.,,She disappeared amongst the crowds but didn’t go far, because I discovered that she had settled inside me.,,,,The Negative Economic Situation, the Lack of Justice, and Corruption Must Be Brought to Trial… Before Researchers of Legal Rights Are Held Accountable,,“Change… Freedom… Social Justice.” Under this slogan, millions of Egyptians mounted the revolution of 25 January. Clear demands drove them to go out into the streets and offer up their blood. Some of these demands have been met, or at least have begun to be met, but many others still have not.,,Mubarak has been deposed, the People’s Assembly has been dissolved, and some corrupt individuals have been brought to trial. But the path to freedom remains a long one. As for social justice, attacks have suddenly begun against those who demand it, and many people ignore the fact that it was one of the revolution’s principal demands. Attacks have suddenly begun against workers and employees who went out even after the fall of Mubarak to demand that their humiliating lives be improved and their stolen rights returned to them.,,Suddenly, these people have become the symbols of the “counter-revolution,” as some have described them. The workers and employees who played a crucial role in toppling Mubarak’s regime—with their strikes and their participation in the revolution—have met with sharp criticism and attacks just a few days after Mubarak’s departure. These attacks signify some people’s belief that what the revolution has realized up to this point is sufficient and there is no need to complete what it was originally initiated to achieve. Those who launch these attacks ignore the fact that the protests and strikes organized by workers and society that Egypt has seen in past years paved the way for the revolution. On the one hand, going out to seek one’s rights has become a matter of custom in Egypt. And on the other hand, the terrible economic situation, lack of justice, and corruption resulting from the previous regime’s policies were the reasons behind these protests, and they were also the reasons why workers went out in revolution. How can we say to them now, “Go home, even though your demands have not yet been met”? Even worse, we are talking about basic demands for the majority of Egyptians; we are talking about the right to live a dignified life. Those who attack these protests attempt to describe the protests’ organizers as selfish people who only want to benefit their own personal interests. These accusations are all incomprehensible and false. What is selfish about workers demanding a stop to the corruption that reigns in the companies and factories for which they work, and that itself reflects a terrifying lack of justice in wage distribution—an injustice which makes it so that CEO’s are paid in the tens of thousands, while these workers only receive a few pounds? What is selfish about temporary employees who have held the same jobs for many long years demanding that their jobs be made permanent? What is shameful about journalists, media-workers, and students demanding that the symbols of the previous regime be removed from their organizations? The truth is that those who criticize the protests are the ones who stand in the way of the revolution. They are the ones who use an illusory “stability” as a pretense—the very same pretense that was used against the revolutionaries during the revolution. It is the same excuse that some people used against the revolutionaries, calling upon them to be satisfied with Mubarak’s appointment of a vice president and his promise that he would not run for another term as president.,,But just as the revolutionaries rejected the pretense of stability, so the workers reject the same pretense. The revolution’s demands have not yet been completed, and it is the responsibility of every one of us to continue the struggle in all possible forms in order to realize our democratic and social demands.,,[Page 4:],We Were Born From the Womb of the Revolution,,On 25 January 2011, the Egyptian youth began a noble revolution that formed a turning point in our history and, indeed, in the history of the world. Over the course of several days, the youth’s spark expanded and transformed into an overwhelming popular revolution in which millions of the Egyptian people’s sons and daughters participated alongside its proletarian masses, granting it a massive momentum and the energy of a struggle that grew even stronger thanks to the youths at its forefront. The revolution succeeded in getting rid of the dictator Mubarak and many of those around him who monopolized power and riches and made corruption and tyranny a matter of course. In this, the revolution inaugurated the birth of a new nation and took the first steps in a long journey towards exacting all of the masses’ political and social demands.,,The revolution exploded against a background of general, overwhelming feelings of social injustice due to economic policies biased toward the rich and the astronomical riches created by a gang of corrupt and tyrannical individuals from the blood of the people by starving them, impoverishing them, and exploiting them. While millions of Egyptians live in slums, sleep on sidewalks, and suffer from hunger and nakedness, mansions and resorts continue to be built for which no residents can be found, and markets overflow with tons of food and clothing for which no consumers can be found. All of this is in addition to the collapse of educational and public health services, the stealing of pension money, and the reduction of all social safety nets.,,The people wanted to topple the regime that hijacked the national economy so that the sectors of tourism, trade, and luxury real estate would control it, while agriculture and production deteriorated. It reach a point where this economy could no longer provide employment opportunities, which forced millions of youths into the abyss of unemployment, and even caused some to risk death in illegal emigration boats, fleeing an inhuman life.,,Under these policies, culture and art were turned into commodities controlled by a mafia of traders and the rules of the market, or else they were besieged by systems of bureaucratic management. The result has been a distortion of consciousness and existence. Culture, the arts, and all areas of creative production deteriorated, and the path was blocked for innovators and creators, who unearthed boulders to let some of their creations see the light.,,The revolution also succeeded in burying the criminal attempts of Mubarak’s regime to ignite sectarian strife among the people’s ranks, along with attempts to isolate Christians from political action. It also succeeded in transforming the slogan “Religion is for God, and the state is for everyone” from mere words into a living, tangible reality throughout the days of the strike in Tahrir Square. Just as the peaceful, struggle-based nature of the revolution and the climate of national brotherhood that permeated it led the peoples of the world to stand with our revolution. It thus became an inspiring example to all the peoples that are struggling for democracy and social justice.,,And from the heart of the revolution the face of Fighting Egypt appeared to remove from its burdened back the dust of years of inaction. Huge brigades of new fighters came out into the light, raising slogans of struggle for the sake of democracy and justice. And in the heart of the revolution, the currents of thought and forces of the Egyptian Left and those struggling for socialism were equal among the people, without any discrimination, power grabbing, monopolizing, or exclusion. They worked side by side with the rest of the democratic- and youth-driven forces, and with all the organizations for change, to bring the revolution to victory. The will to change displayed by the youths struggling for freedom and social justice met with the powers of the Egyptian Left, which represents one of the largest branches of our people’s heritage of struggle, for the sake of liberation, democracy, and social justice.,,The “Popular Alliance” party is born from the womb of the revolution. It broadens to include all the powers of progressive, leftist, and socialist democracy that struggle together towards the slogans that the revolution embraced: “Change, freedom, social justice, and human dignity.”,,The party begins with numerous important positions that reflect the demands of the 25 January Revolution’s masses.,,First: We insist upon the realization of all the demands related to democracy and political reform, and we will not be disparaged from this. These demands include the necessity of distancing all the pillars of the old regime from power and transferring power to a temporary, civil government. They also include dissolving the local councils; revoking Emergency Law, exceptional trials, and laws restricting freedoms; releasing all prisoners; and bringing the symbols of corruption and tyranny to trial. They furthermore include drafting a new constitution that confirms the principle of the separation of powers; ends the domination of the executive authority over the legislative and judicial authorities; subjects the security institutions to popular civilian oversight; affirms the independence of the judiciary and the merits for Egypt of a true parliament that enjoys the powers of oversight and lawmaking; and nullifies all restrictions on establishing political parties, unions, and associations, and publishing newspapers.,,Second: We demand that political change be linked with social change in one framework, fulfilling human rights, redirecting the economy, and putting in place a plan for growth that will benefit the poor masses in Egypt, among them workers, farmers, employees, marginalized groups, small-business owners, and artisans. Their rights to food, shelter, education, work, fair wages, and health care must be guaranteed. Economic and social exploitation, together with the hegemony of monopolies, must be confronted. Minimum and maximum wages must be set, salaries must correspond to market prices, and unemployment subsidies must be paid. Overdue loans to small-time farmers and artisans must be cancelled, and public spending must be directed toward the improvement of public services. Progressive taxes must be placed on the wealthy, and radical agricultural reform must be realized.,,Third: All forms of subordination to Zionism and colonial governments must be opposed. This includes resistance to normalization with Israel, supporting instead the Arab people and all peoples in the world who struggle for the sake of democracy and liberation, and supporting in particular the Palestinian people’s struggle to achieve their freedom and establish a state. This also includes support for all forms of resistance to colonialism, among them armed resistance, with the exception of violent actions directed solely against civilians.,,Fourth: We support the struggle for a civil state—not a religious one, and not a military one. We also demand the separation of religion from politics, and oppose all forms of discrimination on the basis of religion, gender, color, political conviction, or social position. We support the struggle for freedom of thought, expression, creation, and scholarly research.,,The “Popular Alliance” party is a party opposed to capitalist exploitation, capitalist hegemony, and monopolies. It supports the interest of the poor and the producers. It persistently seeks to call upon all workers, farmers, employees, and all the impoverished masses to join its ranks, together with the youths who reject corruption, tyranny, and exploitation, and all intellectuals and creative minds who favor democracy and justice—from different social classes and sects. It is an open, democratic party that allows for a diversity of platforms, currents of thought, and voices within its ranks. Its political positions arise from mutual agreement between its different currents. It forms its bodies and takes decisions based on democratic principles.,,,","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144851im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/POPULAR-SOCIALIST-ALLIANCE.png,imgID148,

“Raise Your Head High” and Participate in Change,2011-05-08,2011,"[Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance, Foundation Issue, Page 2],,“Change… Freedom… Social Justice” Slogans raised by the revolution of which their realization demands a struggle for change.,,The revolution has opened the doors of hope once again in Egypt; hope that each one of us may have a role in drawing the path of this country, hope for a better life as expressed by one of the slogans of the revolution: “Change, Freedom, Social Justice.” This was where the idea was born for founding the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance, which adopts the slogan of social and economic change alongside democratic change.,Indeed, hand in hand with the party’s insistence upon completing the path of transformation towards a full democracy is its belief that the fight for change in social and economic policies is no less important than the fight for democracy. It is unreasonable that 40% of Egypt’s population lives below the poverty line while a limited few possess enormous wealth. It is unreasonable that, every year, billions are being spent to build luxurious real estate and tourist resorts while we suffer from a housing crisis for those with low and moderate income. It is unreasonable that the state leaves millions of those who work in Egypt for wages without protection of their benefits and rights. For this reason, the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance defends the drafting of new policies for growth, which will primarily benefit the poor of this country as they are in the majority.,In the beginning, the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance was founded by the initiative of a group of leftists and socialists who believed that the Egyptian revolution came as a result of the absence of democracy as well as deep-rooted feelings of social injustice among the people. They also believed that the time was ripe to suggest the demand for social change hand-in-hand with democratic change.,The party began its activity in a preparatory conference held in the Trade Union Theater four weeks ago. At the conference, a foundational declaration was released which could be considered both a document of the party’s general principles and an internal list organizing its work during its period of foundation. This foundation period should last for three months and end in a foundational conference after which the party will become publicly announced and in official standing. The party’s temporary work has been divided between five primary committees, which are as follows:,,Party members also took the initiative to form three more committees, which are:,,The party is also currently arranging meetings in different provinces to meet with party membership in various regions and to introduce the party’s activities and general ideas to new members and those who want to join.,,We invite you to join and fight with us to complete the process of change in Egypt.,","Solidarity, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164733im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/POPULAR-SOCIALIST-ALLIANCE.png,imgID150,

Looted Funds from Mubarak’s “Poorhouse”,2011-05-08,2011,"[Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance, Foundation Issue, Page 2],Looted Funds from Mubarak’s “Poorhouse”,,It is difficult for any single expert to estimate the extent of corruption in the thirty years of Mubarak’s rule. This is due on the one hand to the numerous and divergent means of corruption, and on the other, to the regime demanding that many kinds of expenditures be covered up. Nevertheless, it is possible to point to some indicative figures, such as the fact that last year, wasteful spending reached 12 billion Egyptian pounds. On the other hand, the amount of public reserves, which has wavered between 10 and 16 billion Egyptian pounds in past years, is supposed to be spent in case of crises or natural disasters, whereas instead, most of these funds are spent on security forces and bonuses for senior Interior Ministry officials. In the health sector, wasted funds account for more than 300 million Egyptian pounds every year, while approximately 120 million pounds are wasted in the Ministry of Culture alone. Yet another 400 million pounds are transferred from Suez Canal revenues to the pockets of the presidency on a yearly basis. The amount of waste resulting from exporting gas to Israel at a cost less than global market prices is 9 billion pounds. The balances of special funds existing outside of the budget reach 1.273 trillion pounds, or 446% of the total general budget for the state, and those funds are spent far from the supervision of the People’s Assembly.,,On the other hand, there are other forms of corruption regarding the budget besides wasteful spending. For example, the percentage of the total budget spent on security is more than that spent on education, which means that the state spends more on the forces of oppression that keep the regime in place than it spends on the education of its people.,,Besides corruption in spending, there has been vast corruption involved in the process of privatization. This corruption has come in the form of billions lost in shady deals, in which assets owned by the people have been sold for much less than their true value. Such was the case of Al-Nasr Boiler Company, which sold for 15.6 million pounds when the actual value of its real estate alone (31 acres right on the banks of the Nile) had reached 300 million pounds. Furthermore, the salaries of those who run government media represent yet another face of corruption. For example, whereas most of the employees in the institution are paid no more than a few hundred pounds per month, the former executive council president of Al-Ahram used to earn two million, and other senior officials in the Egyptian Radio and Television Union receive similar paychecks.,,In light of just these few allusions, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the extent of corruption during Mubarak’s regime could be estimated at hundreds of billions of pounds. For this reason, it was not coincidental that the Mubarak regime did everything in its power to prevent the revolution’s success, just as it is not a coincidence that the post-revolution regime is risking its life in order to maintain the status quo. Nor is it by chance that the process of bringing the corrupt to trial is going extremely slowly, granting them the time they want to smuggle their funds out of the country. If Egyptians are being subject to military hearings that issue their verdicts in just a few days, would it not be rather more appropriate to expedite quick decision-making in order to retain the money of the corrupt, who have spent decades looting the people’s money?,","Mubarak and Family, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155449im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/POPULAR-SOCIALIST-ALLIANCE.png,imgID154,

The whole world is singing the revolution’s praises and Tahrir Square (and of course all Freedom Squares in every city and every province and in all the Islamic world) has become a symbol of freedom, justice, equality, dignity, pride, social and human justice. It is a symbol of the dream that we, free and honorable citizens, seek to realize together. Egypt is strong and advanced: she is part of a strong Islamic nation of unified Arab peoples and countries. We have the greatest of capabilities and capacities. The greatest of them by far is you, the honorable, free, proud, and Arab Egyptian. You made miracles happen. We believe in God and in all revealed religions. We believe in justice, equality, and the absence of discrimination by one person against another, whether within the nation or Islamic civilization or abroad. There are no differences between man and woman, between rich and poor, between Christian and Muslim, no differences of kind or color. Every Egyptian will work to build Egypt, whether in science, health, culture, literature, or as a civilization to support of a revolution in learning, economics, health, culture, and athletics. Every Egyptian will also work for the elimination of poverty and unemployment.,,The people will govern themselves, and every organization where power is centered will have a free and fair election, starting with town elder, village governor, the honorable Popular and National Assemblies and all those who provided the finest examples of redemption and sacrifice to maintain our country’s security, in addition youth centers, clubs, schools, universities, civil society organizations, local and Parliamentary assemblies of different levels, the Presidential and representatives, local governors, professional and labor unions, student unions, parliament of the vanguard, assemblies of parents and guardians, positions and places in universities (both presidents and governors)… All of the aforementioned and those similar to them will hold elections.

No to Religious Corruption… No to the So-Called Churches,2011-05-05,2011,"No to Religious Corruption…No to the So-Called Churches,Hundreds of Egypt’s sons were martyred in order to bring down the corrupt political system, which is run by a gang monopolizing power and money. This gang is very similar to the current canonical system that continually supported Mubarak and blessed the hereditary rule of his sons. It is no wonder, then, that the present canonical system resembles the now extinct regime in terms of its monopolization and domination of power. Corruption has spread amongst religious men and has especially permeated the layer of the clergy, becoming the blood that runs through their veins. Their hearts have become as black as the color of their robes. It is, therefore, without personal gain or exaggeration that we shed light on some of these corrupt individuals.,Bishop Marqus of Shubra Al-Khayma is arrogant and absurd. He is a master of insult and humiliation even when the subject of these invectives is a poor person or a person with disabilities and special needs. He has been reminded of his responsibilities towards his parishioners and the pious council that follows him. However, this council is one of evil, controlled by a group of wicked, demented priests.,The Priests of the Church of The Virgin and The Archangel Mikha’il in Al-Khalafawi are closest to the devils. Included in this group are men who consider their duty to merely be a job for the money, ignoring the most important injunction which is to love and serve the minor friars. The exceptions to this are the servants of the Sunday schools, for the Lord has witnesses in all times and places.,The Teacher of Generations, Pope Shenouda III, turned away from the problems and concerns of his people. This prompted one of them to commit suicide by self-immolation in the cathedral during a weekly lecture on 3/30/2011. He did not blink an eye nor inquire about the reasons for this suicide.,Finally, a corrupt media supports the entire corrupt system. This is the role of the Coptic Television Channel, CTV. This disingenuous channel works to improve the image of the religious men despite their corruption and their dereliction. The channel is a slave to its main objective: fundraising for itself, by any means necessary, and not for those in need. This is the same objective of the clergymen the channel supports. These charlatans make empty claims in their program, “Ayna Anta,” which is affiliated with this channel.,(Anyone who wishes to contact us can reach us at this number: [phone # redacted]),","Coptic Christians, Religion",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160042im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/No-to-religious-corruption.png,imgID164,
The Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights…,2011-05-04,2011,"What the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights Does in Egypt, Even Israel Couldn’t Do,[Logo text: The Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights],[Lower text: The Egyptian Family],The day has come in which the men of Egypt shout in the streets in order to see and raise their children as the law of God says.,Men who fought colonialism and drank the blood of Zionists in the Sinai are these days unable to have custody of their children for two days.,The Center for Women’s Rights still says Egypt is a male-dominated society,Did you know that an Egyptian father lit himself on fire in front of the People’s Assembly building on January 18th 2011 because he was unable to see his child? Do you know why?,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK2CZe51KxU,What does the law of Suzanne [Mubarak] say about a father seeing his children?,Suzanne’s Law: In the case of divorce it is necessary that children are kept from either their father or mother according to their age. Subsequently, one of the sides has custody of the children and has all rights, and the other side, which does not have custody, does not have any rights to the children—not even to see them. So, how does the side without custody ever see their children?,They have to file a case to see their children that takes around three years in the court because the judge rules that the side without custody can see their children three hours in a week and this is the farthest the Law of Suzanne can go. Likewise, it rules that visitation will not be enforced due to the punishment of the side with custody (if it has not followed the ruling on visitation for three weeks in a row). So, guardianship of the child transfers into the custody of the guardian’s parent for the period of a month. Then after this period, guardianship returns to the custody of the guardian. This means in the end the side without custody sees their children three hours in a month after more than two years in court.,And the law does not forget to destroy the life of the child beginning with the fact that it keeps him away from half of his family ( the side of the family without custody never gets to see the child). When this child comes of legal age the law says that “if you would like to finish the torture of your father [by staying completely with your mother] you can or you can, if would like to torture your mother some, stay with your father.” Imagine a law that makes a child feel like he is one the responsible for torturing one of his parents. Additionally, a child who is kept from one of the sides after divorce is 3 times as likely to use drugs as any child who is part of a joint-custody settlement. Likewise he is four times as likely to have an unsuccessful marriage (if he gets married) compared to a child raised by joint-custody. These are the words of the English government which has a joint-custody law for children starting at age 4.,This is not limited to England. There are 136 countries in the world that have a joint-custody law including the countries of Europe, America, and the majority of the Arab and Islamic countries. Likewise there is a joint-custody law in the Arab Children’s Charter, which Egypt signed.,However, the Egyptian Center for Women’s rights says that the 136 countries that have this joint-custody law are medically backwards and do not understand the needs of the children and religion.,However, the Joint-Custody Law is religiously sanctioned according to the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta’:[1],Fatwa 1504 from 2009 (Look for a copy of the fatwas in the subsequent pages),Fatwa 755 from 2006 from the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Shaykh ‘Ali Guma‘a.,We demand children’s rights (the Minister of Justice is able to implement this with a simple decision that does not require the consultation of the People’s Assembly).,We are seeking to attain rights for our children and we demand visitation for the side without custody (whether it is the mother or father) two days a week with the provision of appropriate assurances to the side with custody that their child will be returned (by preventing the child from travelling or other things like that). We also demand that the side without custody is assured to see their child because the point of the law it to protect the people and their rights.,That holidays and vacations be divided equally between the two sides,That there is recourse to God’s Law in cases of custody and age of custody.,A peaceful march to remove this injustice will be held on April 2nd: then peaceful marches every week.,In Cairo: Twelve noon in front of the Cabinet Building.

And explain the military police’s attack (the military police belong to the army by the way) on the protesters opposing Shafiq’s government on February 25th.

You can disagree with his personal opinions, but surely you won’t agree with the military court’s process: the prosecutor told Michael’s lawyer that he would be sentenced on a specific day, and later he discovers that Michael had already received a sentence of three years. Michael wasn’t even arrested because he said his opinion; Michael was arrested because he published facts.,,Ok, so what do you want?,,The immediate cessation of military trials for civilians, and the transfer of the military sentences that have already been issued to civilian judges.,,The immediate release of the revolution’s youth who were arrested in peaceful protests, and the cancellation of the military sentences that were issued against some of them.,,The cessation of all types of torture in any place in our free Egypt, whether in police prisons, military detention centers, or “Public Security Apparatus” headquarters, and for any person, even convicted criminals.,,Investigation of all the transgressions committed by “some elements of the army” against Egyptian citizens since the beginning of the Armed Forces’ taking power.

Mu’ammar “I’m Delivering an Address to an Empty Square” Gaddafi,2011-05-03,2011,"(Gurnal Vol. 1, Page 10),Mu‘ammar “I’m Delivering an Address to an Empty Square” Gaddafi,,Mu‘ammar Gaddafi is the leader of the Great Libyan Revolution, President of the Great Libyan-Arab Communist Masses, and King of the Kings of Africa, so what would he do if he were just a general? What’s so great about him is that every time he opens his mouth he proves that he couldn’t even be the official speaker for an elementary-school class. He used to say that the English writer William Shakespeare was of Arab descent and that his name was Shaykh Zubayr. When he was defining democracy, he said that the Arabic origin of the word was “dimu al-kirasi” meaning that the rulers would remain (“idumun”) in their seats (“al-kirasi”). He also said that the demonstrators could demonstrate if they like, but that they shouldn’t go out on the streets or into the squares, meaning they could demonstrate in the bathroom, I suppose, and of course God forbid that he ever be called a dictator. He doesn’t want to shut down Facebook, but he will arrest anyone who accesses the site, and he fiercely defended “the woman’s right to vote, whether she be male or female.” While we’re on the topic of women, another great thing about Gaddafi is that in all his travels, he feels the need to surround himself with forty women body guards. And of course his opinions on civil life are also wonderful, as when he said that if we didn’t have electricity in this day and age, we would be watching television in the dark, and that the reverence of parents was more important than obeying your mother and father. What is also new — as they say, The injustice of the calamity is what makes you laugh — is that after reports of three thousand killed and wounded in the past three days, and after ordering airplanes and warships to bomb Tripoli, which is the capital of Libya, by the way, Gaddafi still says that he hasn’t used violence in dealing with the protesters.,May God be with our brothers in Libya.,,Ahmad Hani,,","Libya, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153346im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gurnalPage101.png,imgID167,
From the Shabby Few…,2011-05-03,2011,"[Gurnal, Vol. 1, Page 11],From the Shabby Few….,When I heard the news of Mubarak stepping down from his office, I felt a mighty joy and I started to shout in the square: “the people toppled the regime!” But after celebrating for about an hour I started to think about the next step, for the regime had not yet fallen. Then when we gathered and someone suggested the idea of a newspaper, I felt joy again because we would continue fighting the regime until we completely destroyed it. I felt even more joy when the Street accepted this newspaper and when its ideas expanded to include different projects. So my pride in the Shabby Few increased…,Ziyad Tarek Hassan,19 years old,,[columns from right to left],,The first issue was total havoc; we stayed up and worked through the night for three days in a row. However the emotions at the press when we received Gurnal are something we won’t forget. The feeling that one person really makes a difference, or at very least can try to make a difference. With time it is possible the Gurnal will expand and we will learn how to raise sufficient awareness so we can help make this country a better place.,Hisham Shukrallah,19 years old,,The first issue took a lot of work and there were many problems. There was yelling, hair pulling, and things that I can’t really say more about. The reason for the problems could be that Gurnal is the first true collective work that we undertook as the Shabby Few, or because this is the first time we put together a newspaper. True, our life in Tahrir and then our life together in the apartment brought us closer together, but we were far from being one person. However, all the problems disappeared as soon as I held the first issue in my hands and started to hear the reactions to it.,Maryam Abu Ghazi,20 years old,,They told me we’ll make a newspaper, I said “why not?.” It had been days since someone had beaten us, the president had left the day before and one didn’t know where to channel his energy. I thought of returning to my normal life but the very idea was boring. I figured that this newspaper could be the way to change Egypt for the better. So we started really working on the first copy and we followed through on this, with 5 days of collective work that I never thought I could handle. We printed the first copy successfully and the second copy is already on its way.,Samy Sulayman,21 years old,,The most beautiful feeling in this whole situation was when we received the first print. The ideas that we had dreamed up of for so many days had finally became tangible in our hands. Printed words and drawings speak for themselves. There were thirteen of us distributing and everyone split up to distribute in a different place. I had a thousand and ten copies, forget the ten and let’s say 1,000. The neighborhood I distributed in is one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Egypt, Shubra. One of the best things that happened was an owner of a small shop called his wife on the telephone and had me talk to her— It was at that moment that I felt that I was doing the work of the Street. On January 25th in Shubra those who will not be named abducted me. [translator’s note: i.e. state security or thugs] Then on February 17th, also in Shubra, I was able to exercise my freedom by distributing Gurnal, talking to people and finally breathing freely, as if for the first time, after we deposed Mubarak… do you think that was a coincidence?,Lina Mugahid,19 years old,,The first issue of the newspaper “Gurnal” was very inspiring, starting from the idea to its execution and finally to its distribution.,We have written previously about the apartment and how we all got to know each other there during the Revolution. However, in truth, the first issue helped me get to know the people with me much more than any other event.,Nada al-Murasifi,20 years old,,While we were working on the first issue I felt hopeful about making people aware. We don’t want people to think that the revolution is over and everyone should go home. While I was distributing I saw a lot of happy people—the first time I felt like I was really helping my people. It was a really great experience and as I did it I became close with people who I can trust. I learned from them and came to understand politics.,Mustafa al-Kashif,16 years old,,We tried to make the first issue much better than this but there wasn’t enough experience and organization in work.

We continue to hear promises and declarations without receiving tangible evidence that they will be fulfilled. Until now, we have not recovered the embezzled money and we have not imprisoned the thieves. Instead, these thieves are being only prosecuted for breaking windows during the robbery. This dithering and lawlessness provides the opportunity for others to provoke panic, like the incident at the stadium. Because of this, we want to bring to court the perpetrators of this incident. The police must return promptly so that the police department can begin to serve citizens and cooperate with the people.,It is apparent these days that the severe increase in prices these days is due to the absence of a system of price regulation, and the inability of the Ministry of Supply to regulate these prices, in addition to the overall weak movement of trade in the country. This amplifies the pressures and everyday burdens placed on the average citizen and because of that it is necessary to restore these systems. In fact, the rise in prices is the greatest challenge to the revolution during this current transitional phase; these systems are considered the most dangerous anti-revolutionary force at present. Indeed, with patience, endurance, with the resumption of work and normal life, and with the state’s restoration of these regulatory systems, we can get though this phase. The price of freedom and dignity is not marginal.,The laws that govern the establishment of political parties have remained as they were in order to undercut the revolutionaries and their parties. Until now, there have not been any amendments to or easing of these laws. All of the demands to change them have fallen on deaf ears, just as in the past. This suggests that the current laws have been particularized for certain factions and not for others. Five thousand members are necessary to establish a new political party. How can any nascent party hold a public convention for its members and what venue can accommodate this number of people aside from the Cairo Stadium? Added to that is the question of the members’ personal information; no one knows who will be collecting this personal data, as we previously mentioned in the tenth statement of the Renaissance Party.,We have not stolen anything from the people, nor have we taken land from the state or money from the banks. We have nothing other than a love of country, a desire to serve this country, and a hope for a better tomorrow. We have visions of improvements in education, healthcare, manufacturing, the economy, trade, agriculture, culture, and a media that shows real images of Egyptian society. We also hope for our country’s advancement and that the correct steps will be taken so that it can reach its potential without stopping or regressing. We want a democratic system that allows a peaceful transfer of power. We want to put in place institutions of civilian rule that reference to religious authority. We hope to take strides toward designating our next president, whose name does not concern us.,This is our opportunity to do a service for our nation in order to make a better future for ourselves and for future generations. Indeed, Egypt after the 25th of January does not need to be like the Egypt of the past. After the 25th of January, we have been called on to think about Egypt and for that reason we are putting forth a vision of the future with the Egyptian Renaissance Project. We will make progress in all areas and in all our plans and will build a better tomorrow for ourselves, for our country, and for people who have their own dreams of participating in building Egypt anew. The preservation of the revolution continues, as does participation in a better future for Egypt.

We are One of You: A Campaign for Egypt’s Awareness,2011-05-01,2011,"We are One of You,A Campaign for Egypt’s Awareness,,The Goal,,Our campaign constitutes an awareness movement that we will carry out with volunteers by assembling via Facebook and then heading out to streets, villages, and popular neighborhoods all across Egypt. The goal is to communicate with simple people, making them aware of political, social, and health-related issues, among others. God willing, we will reach all of Egypt. We’ll get closer to our people and kinsmen and tell them that we are one of them and that we concerned about Egypt and about them. We’ll show them the path to liberty. We’ll increase their awareness and educate them on the characteristics of anyone who wishes to deceive and exploit them. We’ll give them the recipe that’ll allow them to distinguish between the candidate who will serve them and the one who will exploit them—not just for the presidency, but also for Parliament and the Local Councils.,,Who We Are,,A group of volunteers who do not follow any political party or political current, we only want to be of service to our country in these critical times. We’ll learn a bit of politics in order to understand what’s happening around us and educate those around us. We are not the Brotherhood, nor the Wafd, nor any other political party. Whether we were ‘yes’ or ‘no’, we must have a role to play in the upcoming period to guarantee our rights and our children’s rights in the future by participating in the change taking place now.,,Activities,,We convene together as volunteers from all over Egypt, whether on the internet or during social events. Our goal is to understand what’s happening on the political scene and to be groups that reach out to people in the streets, explain to them, increase their awareness, and encourage them to participate in the future and to protect their voices. Negativity is unacceptable.,,Join Us,,We all need to partake in this campaign. There are many Egyptians who might be thrilled with the revolution but do not know what is expected of them. And there are many others who did not feel the revolution. In order to change the lingering effects of the past years, we all need to participate. You can participate by sharing a thought, a fact, a suggestion, coming with us to the streets, or even just pointing us to places that might need to be made aware.,,Facebook: (Ihna Minkum: Hamlat Taw‘iyya li-Kul Misr),Website: e7namnkom.org – Email: info@e7namnkom.org,,,Political Concepts,,On the Upcoming Parliamentary Elections,Elections with a Party-List Proportional Representation System,,To implement this system, the state territory is divided into a number of large electoral districts. Accordingly, the number of districts decreases whereas the size of each increases. Each political party presents a list which includes its nominees. The electorates of each electoral district then elect from among the proposed lists, without having the right to make any adjustments to them. The voters’ differentiation among parties will then be based on the political agendas, plans, and policies rather than personal relationships.,,Under this system, the empty seats are distributed between the different political parties, each according to the number of votes it won. Let’s assume that there were three lists competing over ten chairs in a particular electoral district. If the first list won 1000 votes, the second list won 6000 votes, and the third list won 3000 votes, then the ten seats will be distributed in proportion to the number of votes won by each list. Accordingly, the first list would win 1 seat, the second list would win 6 seats, and the third list would win 3. In other words, candidates 1-6 from list 2, the first 3 candidates from list 3, and only the initial candidate from list 1 win seats.,,Advantages of using the Party-List Proportional Representation System,,It makes competition take place between ideas, programs, and principles. It is not a selfish contest between individuals that relieves Members of Parliament of their constituencies’ pressures. This allows the representative to pay attention to national affairs that concern citizens in general and steer away from limited local issues that weaken the Parliamentary level of governance. In addition, it allows society to avoid electoral pressure, buying of votes, and state intervention. Moreover, the party-list system increases citizens’ concerns regarding national public issues. This in turn encourages higher voter turnout because the elector feels that his role is not restricted to electing only one parliamentary representative but rather extends to the election of a number of representatives.,Information on this subject has been copied from two articles by Dr. Munir ‘Azmi Rizq Allah and Dr. Magdi Qarqar.,,For more information about the rest of the parliamentary electoral systems, such as the advantages and disadvantages of each, in addition to lots of other information on all that concerns people on the political scene, you can visit us on our website:,,Discussions: http://board.e7namnkom.org,Facebook: (Ihna Minkum: Hamlat Taw‘iyya li-Kul Misr),Website: e7namnkom.org,Email: info@e7namnkom.org,,","Movements, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162222im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/WeAreWithYou-PoliticalConcepts.png,imgID172,
People of Egypt!  Save Egypt!,2011-05-01,2011,"People of Egypt! Save Egypt!,The Military Council is part of the former regime and it will not effectuate any of the revolution’s demands, nor those of the poor or the unemployed youth. The army is destroying the revolution along with the dreams of the youth, the workers, and the poor. It will not prosecute the corrupt people in the system because they are part of the system. Prosecuting the corrupt and returning the embezzled money to the State’s treasury will allow us to execute projects, employ the youth in industry and agriculture, and develop our country. However, the Military Council has a different opinion. It has started to delay in pronouncing verdicts and has taken to wasting time so the money won’t be refunded from the colluding European banks. It is a clear sign from the Armed Forces that the call for democracy is still unfulfilled. The Emergency Law still exists and they have begun complicating the process of founding a political party. They say that to form a political party it must have at least 5000 members and it should not be based on class differences as if Egypt had no poor and no rich. The political party is then a reflection of the social class to which it is biased, and the party protects the interests of that class.,,The Military Council started building a fez factory, and each citizen wore one. At the beginning of the revolution, they said, “I’m with the revolution and I will execute the revolution’s demands.” Then it started to drain the youth’s enthusiasm beginning with freeing the prisoners and it said, “The thugs are coming!” The people wore the first fez. The Military Council started employing the same techniques that the former regime used to employ for fueling sectarian strife. They started by demolishing and burning the Atfih Church in Hulwan in front of the army and all of the media, but to no avail. And the people wore the second fez.,,You’re free! Say “yes” to the referendum, say “yes” to the bad guys, say “yes” to the former regime, say “yes” to sectarian strife, say “yes” to the Military Council! And the people wore the third fez.,,The Military Council started pleading to the people, saying “Oh citizens! Work with us to save the stock market—the one that belongs to the pashas and thieves—and contribute by donating ten pounds. You’ll be an investor, you poor thing! Oh boy, you’ll be a shareholder in the stock market with ten pounds!” The people wore the fourth fez. I propose to the Military Council and the government that we export fezzes to the entire world, thereby increasing the national income. Let’s employ young men and women in the tourism sector—industry and agriculture are such a pain in the neck.,,You’ll go and say the poor and these problems of theirs are issues that need versatility to be resolved.

Medicine for disease is becoming a difficult issue, both economically and medically. The lord, the glorious and almighty, blessed me with a simple and effective way to treat the majority of incurable illnesses and to reduce the amount of bone pain. This pain can result from accidents or Rheumatoid Arthritis; it can be caused by the treatment of vertebrae, neck, throat, and lung pain, resulting from Pneumonia, Tuberculosis and heart failure, which weakens its function. It is a result of the treatment of the kidneys and the liver from all viruses, mainly the Hepatitis epidemic, along with all of the cancerous types of tumors in people’s bodies. This simple and effective cure happens in a time period no less than five minutes and no more than 8 minutes, allowing three days for the follow-up observation. God singled me out for this and I have conducted mostly successful experiments on a number of individuals, curing them by God’s command. Now, I am attempting to reach the largest possible number of Muslims and Copts of Egypt, hoping that you can help me by shedding light on my idea and spreading my manner of thinking.

The Egyptian Socialist Party,2011-06-26,2011,",,Happy New Year to the workers of Egypt,Happy May first to Egypt on the occasion of the advent of Freedom Day!,,,Labour Day has a special taste this year because it will not descend into “President, our bonus!”, because the bonus is a right separate from the holiday and because the president has unregrettably traveled. The first of May comes months after the revolution of January 25th, the fall of the head of the regime and the continual struggle of the workers of Egypt to complete the revolution and to overthrow the regime.,,The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the ministry of Doctor ‘Isam Sharaf promised us reforms and freedom the legitimacy of which stems from the Tahrir protestors in Egypt. However, on the contrary, a decree was issued to law 12 of 2011 in regards to political parties which placed restrictions and obstacles to the establishment of parties. Among other things, it requires 5,000 signatures in the land registry and the publishing of the names of the founders in two daily newspapers. It requires spending millions [of pounds], thus limiting new parties to the wealthy. Also, the decree to Law 34 of 2011 was established preventing gathering together and raising the penalty to a year’s imprisonment and a possible fine of up to half a million pounds! In spite of the Minister of Labor’ speech concerning the freedom of unions, a law legalizing trade union pluralism has not been issued and the establishment of unions with notification has turned into a fait accompli, which has been imposed on the will of the Egyptian workers before the issuance of the law. Additionally, the former regime’s neglect of the minimum wage continues despite the court’s ruling of administrative justice in this issue.,,Labor protests have taken place since the end of 2006, which were the real foreground to union freedom. It came about in the formation of the real estate tax union and the pension union which were forerunners to the revolution of January 25th. Likewise, the birth of the Egyptian Federation of Independent Unions came from within the heart of Tahrir Square. This reflected the precedence of the workers of Egypt in defending the freedom of unionization as a primary part of the movement of the Egyptian revolution. Since the fall of the head of the regime it has continued into a movement to shape the independent unions and deposit its’ papers in the Ministry of Labor as a step on the way to restoring the freedom to unionize in Egypt. The freedom to unionize is the heart of political freedoms.,,In addition to that, the issuance of a judicial ruling of the Supreme Constitutional Court invalidated law 100 of year 1993 regarding professional unions in order to support the establishing of independent professional unions. It began with the independent journalists, then the workers, as well as the continual efforts to establish an independent union of the faculty members of universities.,,As for the issue of wages, the share of wages from the GDP has decreased from 40.3 percent yearly to 33.3 percent in 1985, reaching 28.2 percent in 2005 and 20 percent in 2010.,,Salaried workers, along with their families represent almost 95% of the Egyptian people and take up 20 percent of the income, whereas 5% of the Egyptian people obtain 80% of the income as profit, benefits, and the proceeds of land and property. It is noticeable that the wage structure is generally disturbed, for the wages of the government are equivalent to 20% of basic wages and 80% changing wages. As is seen in the budget there are more than 20 kinds of bonuses and incentives and 32 kinds of allowances.,,In other matters, the government and companies have expanded the use of temporary employment, which is exempt from guaranteed labor rights. On the other hand the numbers of advisors who obtain outrageous wages have swelled without any regulations for all of the ministries, agencies and companies. This disparity is reflected in any ministry, where we find central government employees who have obtained the several times the wages of the workers in the municipal offices and agencies of the same ministry.,,With all of this, the issue is not merely limited to setting the minimum wage that suffices to sustain the worker and his family (5 members), but in placing a minimum wage and wage ceiling not exceeding 15 times the amount of the minimum wage with a link between the wages and prices as well as the standard of living. For it is inconceivable to be able to rent the cheapest apartment for about 300 pounds while the salaries of the employees in the provincial centers of information are 98 pounds. Market oversight, prevention of monopolies, and facing corruption in imports can significantly reduce the sting of the prices which threaten the workers of Egypt.,,As such, the Egyptian Socialist Party strives for:,,,Long live the first of May, the day of freedom…long live the struggle of the workers of Egypt…. long live the January 25 revolution.,,,The Egyptian Socialist party,1 May 2011,,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163331im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/The-Egyptian-Socialist-Party-1.png,imgID179,

In Disagreement with the Constitutional Amendments,2011-06-24,2011,"In Disagreement with the Constitutional Amendments – and I Demand a New Constitution or the 1954 Constitution – To Limit the Powers of the President of the Republic,In order to make Egypt better – I totally agree with voting by national number and by means of the Internet and other ways – However, I don’t agree with the constitutional revisions of March 19th, 2011 – I demand a new Constitution or that the 1954 Constitution be put into effect – I ask all Egyptians to say “No No No No No” on March 19th, 2011 – God willing,And the reasons are :-Article 75: I don’t agree with it – more than 4.5 million Egyptians have to live abroad because of the injustice of the corrupt regime and the failure to provide equal opportunities – they’re Egyptians according to the law that allows them to have multiple nationalities – they’re on the verge of waiving their other citizenship for Egypt’s sake – they hope to return to the mother country Egypt – this article is unjust and doesn’t treat all Egyptians equally – Egyptians abroad are among the sources of national income – there should be a maximum in the Article regarding the age of the candidate, 70 years for instance,Article 76: I don’t agree with it – this article doesn’t give equal opportunities for candidacy – there’s one party with a single vote in the People’s Assembly that nominates someone for the presidency, another has to reach an agreement of thirty votes from the two chambers , and yet another one must get 30,000 votes from the governorates – is this equal opportunity??? Of course not –- a single condition is good enough for everyone and it’s better that the necessary condition be – “That the candidate obtains the support of no less than 30,000 citizens eligible to vote from fifteen provinces at least, and no less than 1,000 supporters from each province” – This will give equal opportunities to each candidate to visit the different provinces and to present their electoral program in each province to get votes, and maybe there should be debates among some of the candidates in the governorates. That way, there’ll be a chance for the growth of party politics and political life in the governorates, and they will be able to participate in a real and positive way.,Article 77: I agree with adding the phrase, “for one additional term over the period of life.”,Article 88: I agree with it provided that the members of the Supreme Judicial Commission are limited from now on, and in addition that the phrase “The Supreme Commission, judicially formed, assumes complete responsibility for elections and formal referendums, and it should be composed of : the head of the Court of Cassation – the head of the Court of Appeals – the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court – and the most senior vice-chairman from each of these courts, and the most experienced of these should assume the presidency of the Commission,Article 93: I don’t agree with it – The Court of Cassation should have jurisdiction over the validity of membership in the People’s Assembly – not the Supreme Constitutional Court, because it doesn’t have the necessary number of judges,Article 139: I don’t agree with it – the Vice President of the Republic should be elected to be for the people and because he’s of the people – he shouldn’t be appointed, and he should be second in the number of votes, he shouldn’t be required to come from the same party as the President of the Republic, and the Constitution should specify the duties of the Vice President of the Republic.,Article 148 : I agree with it,Article 179 : I agree with removing it,Article 189 : I don’t agree with it – the President of the Republic must be obliged to demand revisions to the Constitution – it’s not the cabinet’s place to agree on that, because the government represented in the cabinet has been formed or reformed according to the President of the Republic’s decision. How can their agreement to revise the Constitution be required?,Article 189 Repeated : I don’t agree with it – the Shura Council must be removed – this is a repetition of parliamentary life and a waste of public money along with the state’s and the people’s time.,This is in addition to the fact that other Articles in the constitution must be heavily revised, since their presence limits democratic life and helps to create a dictatorship in the system,My fellow Egyptian : If you agree with these opinions, please photocopy and distribute them.,","Constitution, March Referendum",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130154608im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/InDisagreementwith.jpg,imgID181,

We must clarify that this order is invalid in two respects: first, because the deposed dictator had transgressed the Constitution – as usual – as a law for organizing the principles of the transition of power. This was before the people deposed him and overthrew his regime, i.e. his Constitution. Second, because the success of the revolution truly indicates the fall of Hosni Mubarak and his regime – i.e., his Constitution – or any order issued by him for any purpose.,,The New Constitutional Announcement = Revolutionary Legitimacy Is the Source of the Supreme Council’s Power,,However, the phrase “New Constitutional Announcement” indicates – politically and constitutionally – that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces derives its power from the revolutionary legitimacy that overthrew Mubarak and his regime – i.e. the Constitution – by undertaking revolution – and it summarily refuses to let the invalid order issued by Mubarak to it (the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces) to run the country’s affairs be the source of its authority for setting the new principles for the new regime.,,Revising 8 Articles of Mubarak’s Corrupt Constitution = Reviving 203 Other Articles that the Overthrown Government Created…83 Million NOs,,According to everything already stated, the Supreme Council’s call to seek expert opinions on revising the Constitution – since they did not annul it immediately – puts it completely at odds with the idea that the army has joined the people in their revolution. What follows is the decisive factor: if the Supreme Council did not realize immediately that the revolution had dispensed with Hosni Mubarak and his Constitution and the transfer of power that he authorized – to say nothing of its invalidity – then the Supreme Council automatically became the continuation of Mubarak’s regime and lost its revolutionary legitimacy after Mubarak’s transfer of power became invalid. Its presence in the seat of authority then becomes unlawful and even dictatorial, completely at odds with the revolution and its political and legitimate implications.,It must also be pointed out that the constitutional announcement could be made in the space of a few weeks (the constitutional announcement isn’t a complete Constitution) – for the constitutional announcement consists of a few articles designed for a transitional period until a new Constitution comes out. Things will remain peaceful and grant us a better future rather then take us back to the days of pilfering and corruption.,,The Revolution Overthrew the Regime = Constitutional Revision is Invalid,,In light of these variables and the contradiction between the authority and the lawfulness of its decisions, we demand that the Supreme Council issue a proclamation reassuring the people of its firm belief in the following things: that the revolution has succeeded – something it has not yet done – and which cannot be done without, that the source of the power accorded it temporarily is revolutionary legitimacy, that Mubarak’s rule and his regime have fallen, and that it has no relationship whatsoever to the overruled transfer of power issued by the dictator deposed by the revolution.,,Revisions to Mubarak’s Corrupt Constitution .. The Continuation of His Corrupt Regime .. 83 Million NOs,,Any outcome without the aforementioned is – practically, politically, and legislatively – the beginning of new corruption in power, a veiled dictatorship, and illegitimacy. This will not lead to any kind of positive stability. We want a peaceful and targeted resolution – not one in form only - to end the revolution and secure its precepts in a solid foundation from which there is no looking back. There should be no use of the word “stability” in calling for an invalid ruler – as the deposed dictator taught us over the course of thirty years of a corrupt stability – and as the corrupt old guard wants along with anyone who bargains with them to make us fail now.,,A Call To Everyone Who Undermines the People in the Name of Religion,,Likewise mention must be made of everyone who is trying to undermine the citizens in the name of religion by issuing a fatwa saying that voting is a legal obligation when it is actually in manifest error. To he who lets himself – whoever he may be – hastily go after after seats in the People’s Assembly in the name of religion – so that he wins in the elections before the youth can get organized – without regard for the well-being of the nation, and reveals his determination to go the dictatorship route in the name of religion: we remind him that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab – may God be pleased with him – disagreed with the Prophet himself – God’s peace and blessing be upon him – on matters of opinion. God’s messenger did not contradict him at all, then Gabriel came down with a revelation from God and a recitation for the Prophet to support ‘Umar : so let us be more modest, and let us express our opinions without prohibiting other opinions in the name of religion as Imam Shafi’i advised – may God be pleased with him – and whose knowledge exceeds that of those who gave the fatwa to you.,,The People Want the Announcement of a New Constitution ..

Ayman Ahmad Salim: “Letter…to the Muslim and Christian People of Egypt”,2011-06-18,2011,",,I am an Egyptian citizen and an engineering officer in the Armed Forces. I’ve worked in Military Intelligence from 1993 until now. I’m sending a sincere message from the heart to the Egyptian people in order to fix our country.,,I request the Egyptian people to go out on Friday, December 10, 2010, after Friday prayers in front of mosques and churches, head to the Presidential Palace, and participate in civil disobedience demanding the fall of Mubarak. In the event of the army’s deployment, we will defy the curfew and continue the sit-in until and after Mubarak’s fall.,,The Egyptian people will select a presidential council for the country’s presidency, comprised of an elite group of judicious leaders from amongst the best experts and scholars who have distinguished themselves on a on the world stage. This elite group will be in charge of our affairs instead of His Majesty King Mubarak and his son. It will present to the people the best solutions, which they deserve. This is so that every official in Egypt will know that the people are capable of presenting their complaints to the President directly without an intermediary and that the president is intent on solving the people’s problems. This elite group will undertake this by following the most modern methods of management in administering the affairs of the country. We will not accept the occurrence of differences among them nor division amongst ourselves. We will not respond to any outside attempts to sow social strife between the sects of our people. O Muslims and Christians, beware of this social strife.,,This presidential council that has been selected for you is comprised of the following seven leaders. I hope they all agree to assume this responsibility if the people choose them, and devote their duties and well-being in order to attain a greater good, the revival of Egypt.,,1) Dr. ElBaradei: Professor of International Law and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, because he risked himself and placed himself in front of the gun through his work with the National Association for Change, embarked on attempts for political reform in Egypt, and did not fear confrontation with Mubarak and the security forces.,,2) Dr. Faruq al-Baz: noted scholar of geology and Egyptian landspace. For more than 30 years, he has undertaken the study of Egypt’s wealth of nature through satellite images and several scientific studies. He has declared in the media that Egypt cannot be a developing state when it possesses so much unexploited wealth.,,3) Dr. Zuwayl: the famous Egyptian scholar that has tried to raise the level of learning in Egypt and started to establish a “Technology Valley” in the Sinai. However, the corruption of the ruling regime in Egypt prevented the project from being completed.,,4) Dr. Ahmad Abu al-Nur: expert and Professor of Human Resource Management, Oppressed Economies, and Crisis Management at West Strathmore University in California. He is an expert in evaluating and restructuring institutions, and is a member of Amnesty International and an expert in UN development.,,5) Dr. ‘Amr Khalid: achieved great success on the national level in ethical reform, youth thought, and harnessing and utilizing their energy in beneficial projects. He also succeeded in developing charitable work in the Arab world. He has significant familiarity with the problems of the people, gained through reading the thousands of letters he receives on his internet website. Pressure from the security forces led him to stop his television program that he used to present from Egypt. He was then forced to leave Egypt and travel in order to complete his work from abroad following the continued increase of pressure from the security forces.,,6) Dr. Milad Hana: famously known as the “Engineer of the Poor”, Hanna presented a number of studies related to solving housing crises and ways to build low-cost housing for the poor and those with limited incomes. He has spent his life trying to solve the housing problem in Egypt.,,7) Dr. and Engineer Ayman al-Tajir: a representative from the Armed Forces and one of its most notable scholars of electronics. Hehas succeeded in carrying out a number of advanced studies and projects inside and outside of Egypt. He is a fine and distinguished role model, trained and educated within the Armed Forces. He works as a professor in the College of Military Arts. His low military ranking does not preclude him from taking this position because it is a political position on the presidential council and not a military position based on seniority. The majority of these seven aforementioned leaders has achieved great success in a number of European and American countries and has gained a lot of experience there after suffering in Egypt and being forced to leave due to administrative corruption. Also, they are the ones who are most sensitive to the country’s problems given their own negative experiences with them; they are not isolated from Egypt’s problems.,,,Oh Army of Egypt:,,I am of you, and you are of the people. The army has undertaken a great coup d’état before, on July 23rd, 1952, in order to fight corruption despite the fact that such corruption was far less than it is now. After the coup d’état – successful up until now – it became forbidden for those employed by the army to take out their voting card and express their opinion with it in presidential elections. Is it acceptable for our opinion to be cancelled out given that we are the owners of the July 23rd revolution? We must have a say, and we must agree completely with the will and the opinion of the people. We must support and protect it, not vanquish and demolish it―lest massive division, losses, and civil war occur.,I implore you to save Egypt by uniting with its people, supporting and protecting them during their quest to express their opinion. Do not follow through with carrying out plans to break up the unrest or to impose a curfew in order to pressure the people. Commit to protecting Egypt from those on the outside and to safeguarding it from the saboteurs on the inside who may even be present amongst the people, working to sabotage any reform efforts. Declare your position before the people to assure them that you are with them. Form a partnership with the people in a united stance like we did in 1952. This will be to all of your children’s benefit. The faction that benefits from today’s corruption will not be able to face off against you.,,Oh Police of Egypt:,,Despite the fact that many of you are subjected to pressure, as well as suffering and significant problems due to the administrative corruption in the Interior Ministry and in the country more generally, your duty is to commit to complete calm, join the people, and not oppose them. You must treat them well and protect them, ensuring their complete safety―especially in this transitional phase―until general well-being returns to us all. Be an object of respect and esteem for the people.,,Oh People of Egypt:,,Changing the President of the Republic is not enough to reform the country. We must all stand as one and change ourselves as well. It is necessary for us to be changed before we implement change. For our Lord has said, “Indeed, God only changes those who change themselves.” We must remain civilized and characterized by calmness and good ethics, lacking fanaticism and violence. We must improve our interactions with each other, forgive each other, smile at each other, make life easy for each other, preserve the cleanliness of our neighborhoods and our streets, follow the traffic laws, and drive our cars while giving pedestrians the opportunity to cross the street with safety and ease. For the Prophet has said, “Be easygoing, do not be difficult, and be happy, not incongruous.” And he has also said, “I was sent to inculcate good morals.” We must all unite in order to lift Egypt up, and we must forget all of our other problems, big or small. Every set of opponents, or separated spouses, must concede, forgive one another, and unite, for their main goal must be lifting Egypt up for the sake of their children. For the Prophet also says, “The best of you begin by making peace.” Do not be too superior or too haughty to begin by making peace and conceding to the other, for that is the way to unite together for the sake of Egypt’s revival.,,Lastly, I say to everyone who dares to falsify my message and attack me or claim that I am mentally unstable that it makes no sense that a mentally unstable individual can continue as an officer for 17 years in the Military Intelligence and do distinguished work―as many officers in the Armed Forces can testify to―and receive major awards from the Minister of Defense and previous Directors of Intelligence, be welcomed in Egypt as well as in a number of foreign countries, and obtain two master’s degrees in engineering. No such mental instability was discovered throughout this period despite success in all of the psychological examinations conducted by the Armed Forces prior to traveling abroad for extended periods.,,By Ayman Ahmad Salim,National Number: 13300103040962,,This message was posted by Ayman on his personal website on the internet and on Facebook, but saboteurs deleted the website and the Facebook page from the internet.,,,AND THE SURPRISE,,Ayman Ahmad Salim was arrested on December 7th, 2010 and placed in a military hospital for psychological illnesses in Ma‘adi. He was placed in a floor completely to himself in order to ensure his silence. He has not been released up to this point.,,We urge the Egyptian people to go out and participate in the second revolution of rage on May 27th to petition for these demands, request the release of Ayman Ahmad Salim, the April 9th officers, and all political prisoners―military and civilian, and reject the trying of civilians in military courts.,,To communicate on Facebook with the Front to Defend Ayman Ahmad Salim: http://www.facebook.com/AymanSalemDefense,,Our date is Friday, May 27th, 2011, The Second Revolution of Rage,Tahrir Square,,","Military, Prisoners, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155630im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LETTER1.png,imgID187,

Third Statement of the People’s Revolution,2011-06-16,2011,",The Third Statement of the People’s Revolution,The Conspiracy Exposed and Demands for Salvation,It may seem like the many events took place in the last few days were a coincidence. All of them, however, have to be analyzed, their lessons extracted, and critical procedures concerning them adopted. We relate several of these as follows:,,This giant wave of violent incidents and reactions on the Egyptian stage is a sharp, dangerous turn in the revolutionary process. This underscores our political analysis of the dangers that threaten us which we put down in the “First Statement of the People’s Revolution.” In the international arena, the people’s diplomacy succeeded in putting out the fuse of the Nile water crisis. This paved the way forward for official diplomacy to resolve the crisis conclusively, just as official diplomacy had succeeded in ending the long period of Palestinian disunity in one swoop. It would send a message to the foreign powers opposed to the revolution, that the Egyptian revolution, in spite of the past conspiracies from outside and complicity from within, was set upon the path to restoring Egypt’s role in the region. All this, despite the fact that the revolution, in its third month, is still incomplete. As for the domestic sphere, although there was limited success in removing the corrupt regime, its figureheads fell like autumn leaves. Despite the people’s hatred for them, they were given fair trials, although some have been described these trials as farcical. This delivered the message to the anti-revolution domestic powers that anyone who did not yet fall inevitably would.,,Among the simple ways of analyzing of the existing domestic powers is to consider the domestic enemies of the revolution. They are:,As for the external enemies of the revolution, they are:,Now the picture is complete, clarifying the connections of interests among the enemies of the revolution domestically and abroad. All of them benefit from the sectarian strife and chaos inside Egypt, and the only losers are the revolutionary powers and its youth. The sectarian strife will work to rein in the revolution, shackle it, drain its energy, and steer it off-course. So, rather than channeling the revolutionary energies to build and restore our regional role, they will dissolve the internal sectarian conflicts which leads in the end to government stability in the hands of an alliance composed of the remains of the authoritarian regime and the religious powers seeking to send the country back fourteen centuries. They use religion to achieve political gains at the expense of their people. They use intellectual and cultural desertification, to which the military police government was devoted throughout the sixties, as an appropriate environment to plant myths and reconstruct backwardness and tyranny. Today everyone has forgotten the demands of the revolution and how to achieve them. All powers are being directed at extinguishing the infinite sequence of sedition ignited by the religious powers until the last infidel Copt is eliminated, as they claim.,The preceding affirms the following and the way in which to confront it with strong demands and insist on their implementation:,No to the conspiracy; yes to supporting the revolution.,Victory for the youth of the revolution and glory to the Egyptian people,","Demands, Military, Movements, Regime, Revolution, Security Forces, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155706im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/kashf.png,imgID189,

"In Order to Free Jerusalem, Egypt Must be Freed",2011-06-14,2011,"In Order to Free Jerusalem, Egypt Must be Freed,God has decreed that the people of Egypt be the ammunition of the nation, its munitions, and its beating heart. Looking to the history of nations, the stories of our ancestors shall be seen and told, for the blood of the righteous martyrs asserts the extent of our linkage to our roots and the purity of our character until the end of time.,Egypt, now on the path of freedom and honor, is a symbol, exemplifying an inspiring beacon of light for all Arab-Islamic people.,The martyrs fell in the squares of Egypt so that the Egyptian people could gain liberty, chanting “Overthrow the Regime.” The agents of the regime were overthrown along with the strategic treasure of the Zionist entity. However, until now the Camp David Accords have yet to be overturned.,We start with our responsibility—one which we welcome being incumbent upon us—to complete the path of freedom by using our own hands to remove the contaminated stain on the history of glorious Egypt and dignify the heart of the Arab-Islamic nation.,For you my Arab-Egyptian brothers and sisters, the reasons it is incumbent upon us to repeal the “Camp David” Accords:,[Page 2],Get to know us yourself; don’t ask or listen to anything about us from anyone other than us:,The Arab-Islamic Front for the Liberation of Palestine – Egypt –,The Front:,It means a collection of political parties, independent individuals, ways of thinking, and popular movements which, while they may appear different, all have the same goal from the same starting points (we recommend reading the Front’s foundational document for an explanation of these points).,Arab: means any person who lives on this land, Muslim or Christian, Kurdish or Amazigh, whatever his belief or race may be, his being is mixed with the earth and culture of this nation. He carries its concerns and sacrifices himself for its sake.,Islamic: the Arab nation was not made and unified until after the spread of Islam throughout the land. Islam was a central component in the creation of the nation’s identity and the writing of its history, drawing of its map, and creation of its culture, which is not incompatible with its customs. In fact, it weighs most heavily upon the culture and its purity. Islam helped to build a single civilization which included all the components of this nation. The spread of Islam made this nation a beacon for the religion, spreading justice, benevolence, equality, and freedom for every person.,For the Liberation of Palestine: our goal. The goal of all the nation’s sons together. In principle, it cannot happen while the Zionist entity is on this land. The Jews intend to live on this land, and there is no objection to that happening as it previously did, under the nation’s umbrella of Islamic civilization.,Egypt: following the revolution of freedom, it is up to the Egyptian people to return to the primary, axial goal and work to liberate the nation and unify it.

Foundational Announcement of the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,2011-06-14,2011,"Logo: The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,Foundational Announcement of the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,With its brave revolution on January 25th, the Egyptian people achieved glorious victories that had long been a dream for millions. These began with the overthrow of the deposed dictator and the figureheads of the regime of looting, impoverishment, and political corruption and bringing them to court. They continued with the dissolution of the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council along with the corrupt ruling party. The end has not yet been reached; it waits for greater determination to meet the goals of the revolution: change and social justice. It was our revolution that was able to stun and confuse the regime of poverty and despotism, just as it inspired hope in social change and a move towards dignity, freedom, and social justice. During the darkest days of the revolution, the time of the attacks from gangs of thugs and the organized withdrawal of the police, the Popular Committees were born. They were formed spontaneously and automatically, assuredly united together—and originating from—the Egyptian people who insisted, courageously, on standing against intimidation, robbery, and organized killing. These Committees, which were the safety valve for society and a method of protecting and advancing the revolution, were formed firmly, with all bravery, against the ruling regime of gangs. Hold on, for our civilization is not just words in history books, but also struggle and steadfastness in the face of killing and the robbery of the daily bread and property of the people. The Popular Committees continue to assume the various functions of defending the revolution and its goals, upon which millions agreed. These committees operate in agreement with a code of conduct ingrained in the true values of the Egyptian people:,- Dependence on voluntary efforts in neighborhoods, villages, hamlets, cities, and centers according to individual circumstances,- Solidarity with the principles of the revolution (dignity-freedom-social justice) despite the different political backgrounds of committee members,- Non-subordination to any governmental body, party, institution, organization along with the refusal of any financing from any actor, whether they be private, governmental, local, or foreign,The Popular Committees have become necessary for the defense of the revolution. The people need them to organize and mobilize the revolution’s masses and to be one of the ways to work on:,- Outreach and spreading awareness of democracy and social justice, without which freedom for society cannot be achieved,- Oversight and popular participation in the matters of society and its administration in a positive manner. This oversight includes services which the state undertakes (such as education, health, utilities, sanitation services, and the environment) as well as oversight of local agencies and the police,- Participation in plans to build the country and development through studies, discussion, coordination, and taking scientific and popular opinions on the state’s plans for neighborhood growth and development on two levels, local and national, to meet the needs of the revolution’s masses,- The participation of the people’s children without discriminating between men and women or discrimination between religious beliefs. Everyone has been united and agreed upon the goals of the revolution and upon building justice and democracy,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are democratically working on coordination, cooperation, and exchange of information and knowledge among themselves, based on discussion and popular conversations open to the public. To achieve the voluntary missions, the Popular Committees utilize specialists in every field. The Popular Committees’ volunteers are working to achieve the short-term goals of the revolution, including:,- Quick and public trials of the deposed President, his family, and the rest being brought forward for investigation or trial without releasing them until their final sentencing for all their political and criminal offenses,- Forming a civilian presidential council for the administration of the country during the transitional period and the army’s return to its barracks for the protection of the country,- A general election for a drafting committee to draft a new Constitution which recognizes justice and democracy in a civilian parliamentary republic,- Holding parliamentary elections according to a proportional-list system, with voting to be done by national number, depending on completely new electoral lists,- Dissolving the Local Councils and holding new elections for their members on the basis of a new democratic law,- Direct election of governors, neighborhood and city mayors, village chiefs, shaykhs, university presidents, and college deans,- Activating the role of popular oversight over the nation’s institutions and officials,- Forbidding the presentation of civilians to military tribunals, the release of all prisoners of conscience, and the retrial of all those tried before military tribunals in civil court,- Restoring the nation’s lands, which the corrupt seized, and using them to house the youth, those living in shanty towns, and the residents of the graveyards,- Confiscating the factories which were sold in agreement with privatization plans and developing them in order to assist in reducing the rate of unemployment,- Dissolving the national security apparatus which is nothing but a continuation of the State Security Apparatus that was responsible for the torture, intimidation, and surveillance of the people,- Establishing a police service under popular and judicial supervision and dissolving the Central Security Apparatus,- Repealing legislation that restricts the freedom of opinion, demonstrating, sitting-in, and striking, the law of new parties, and the law of the thugs,- Repealing the Emergency Law,- Placing a minimum wage no less than 1500 EGP/month and a maximum not to exceed 15 times the minimum wage,- Indefinite cessation of the exportation of gas to the Zionist Entity and the Qualifying Industrial Zones Agreement that both serve to support the occupying entity and striving to build an independent national policy,With the spread and growth of the Popular Committees, it is possible to achieve the hopes and dreams of the people regarding:,Holding accountable the President of the Republic and ensuring this occurs, as well as his Vice President, the Prime Minister, and the government – national growth based on developing the production sectors, limiting foreign investment and dependency, and the just distribution of wealth – equitable development between rural and urban areas – just tax legislation, proportionate with income – equal growth for neighborhoods and provinces, without distinction – support for and the development of culture and the arts to enrich and rejuvenate popular heritage – real support for women.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution call on all citizens eager for development for the sake of the people, not for the sake of investment—the aim of which is to only accumulate profit, to join and participate through voluntary work.,","Politics, The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151609im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/popularcommitteesfoundationaldocument.png,imgID193,
The Front of Socialist Forces: Against Intolerance and Sectarianism,2011-06-13,2011,"Against Intolerance and Sectarianism, For a Civil State,What happened in Imbaba on the 7th of May represents a dangerous turning point regarding the problem of sectarianism. It threatens the nation’s existence and the future of Egypt and is part of a plan to strike at the Egyptian Revolution, preventing the completion of its goals. The powerful forces of the counter-revolution have not stopped since the investigations of the corrupt leaders and their verdicts. Destabilization attempts continue in light of relaxed security and absence of the state. Likewise, some of the media have not attempted objective reporting but instead play with the fire of sectarianism in order to burn the country.,The Front of Socialist Forces denounces the slowness in bringing those responsible for the events of Atfih and Qena to trial and issuing exemplary verdicts against them, which would stop the bloodbath in which the forces of the counter-revolution and retrogressive religion are drowning us. The Front views the government’s delays in issuing a common law on places of worship and their activities, the criminalization of inciting social strife and hatred, creating a common Personal Status Law, and its continuing to use the Customary Councils and men of religion (those that are not official) to counteract sectarian crises as something helping to break down the nation and security. They have caused citizens to resort to religious institutions and use personal methods of protection to defend themselves and their property. It is a matter which might lead us all into a national catastrophe; civil war might break out all over creation.,The Front warns against the escalation of calls for the employment of outside forces to protect Egyptian Christians. These calls are another catastrophe since America, Israel, and their allies are the ones who supported Mubarak’s regime, and he ravaged civil liberties. They are interested in igniting social strife and breaking Egypt up as part of a new plan for the Middle East that they are striving to achieve with the breakups of Iraq, Sudan, and Libya.,The Socialist Forces are working to build a modern civil state… a state of knowledge and rational thought which makes all citizens equal as far as rights and duties through the enacting of a democratic Constitution… a state based on law, equality, human dignity, freedom of worship, freedom of belief, freedom of thought, expression, and creativity—far from the authority of the religious institutions which mix religion and politics… a civil state that respects religious beliefs of all types and ensures that all its citizens enjoy human rights, not discriminating between one Egyptian citizen and another on the basis of religion, origin, race, or gender, with the law vigorously applied for everyone. Accordingly, the Socialist Forces refuse transforming Egypt into a religious state based upon discriminating between citizens according to their religious beliefs. The Front also rejects the use of religion as a pretext to impose a repressive, totalitarian regime as has happened in other countries like Iran, Sudan, and Afghanistan and which has led to political, economic, and social catastrophes.,So, let’s join forces to protect the revolution and complete its missions. Let’s fight together to achieve:,5/12/2011 The Front of Socialist Forces,,","Other Parties, Politics, Religion, Sectarian Strife",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160428im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/against.png,imgID194,
The Party of Popular Socialist Alliance: We Refuse a Pardon for Mubarak,2011-06-13,2011,"Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance,(Under development),,We Refuse a Pardon for Mubarak… and Opening Fire on Demonstrators,,The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance is closely following the various negative and dangerous signs that call to mind some of the practices of the Mubarak regime: opening live fire on those demonstrating in memory of the forcible occupation of Palestine in front of the embassy of the Zionist enemy… unknown parties opening fire and throwing Molotov Cocktails in Maspiro, attacking those protesting against the criminal acts carried out against the churches of Egypt… to say nothing of some of the announcements that have been issued solely to alarm the people… Yet all of these negative indicators put together are surpassed by the pardon of Mubarak and his family along with many who represented his corrupt, tyrannical regime.,The party believes that the growing insecurity in the country is a result of: a weakening resolve to cleanse state institutions of their tyrannical and corrupt elements… a slow pace in bringing key members of the previous regime to trial… the failure to uphold the aims of the revolution, especially those of change, freedom, human dignity, and social justice… the security apparatus’ reluctance to throw out the extremists and thugs within its ranks, instead focusing its efforts on suppressing all forms of peaceful, democratic protests.,In light of this, the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance asserts the following:,,First: The party completely rejects any pardon of the crimes committed by Mubarak, his family, and the cornerstone figures of his rule throughout the past thirty years, and it underscores the necessity of quickly bringing all those accused of political and financial corruption to trial… The party, along with all of the revolutionary powers, is on guard against any attempt, under the terms of any agreement, or under any pressure, to clear these individuals’ records of the crimes they committed against the rights of the people.,,Second: The party condemns the horrible oppression that demonstrators faced in front of the Israeli embassy and calls for the trial of the leaders who ordered the opening of fire and the elements who carried out those orders…. The party pledges that it will support and take part in every activity that targets the territories of the Zionist enemy and every struggle that seeks to establish a democratic, secular state over the entire land of Palestine.,,Third: The party condemns the assault on protestors in front of Maspiro, and demands that the criminals who carried out these assaults—in addition to the attacks on the two churches of St. Mina and the Holy Virgin, among others—be found out… They also demand the rapid enactment of the Unified Worship Law… and the development of legislative, cultural, and intellectual opposition against all forms of religious discrimination.,,Fourth: The party confirms its basic positions: the need to form a civil governing council to take control of the country’s affairs during the transitional period; the election of a drafting council to draft a new constitution for the country that will uphold civil liberties, inspired by the spirit of the January revolution and its major aims, criminalize of all forms of exclusion, exceptionalism, monopoly-formation, or indulgence, and guarantee every citizen’s rights to work, education, housing, due process, and good health.,,Long live the struggle of the Egyptian people… towards a free and democratic country in which all factions are united.,","Politics, The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151740im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/refuseapology.png,imgID195,

Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance: Together to Complete the Tasks of the Revolution,2011-06-09,2011,"Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance,(Under Construction),Together to Complete The Tasks of The Revolution,,Despite its having toppled Mubarak the dictator and Shafiq’s ministry, as well as having weakened the oppressive State Security apparatus, the glorious January 25th revolution has not yet completed its tasks; rather, these successes have paved the way for igniting political and social conflict about Egypt’s future. This conflict pits the powers of the revolution, which hope to sweep away the old regime, against the powers of the counter-revolution, which aim to abort the January 25th Revolution and retain the old regime.,We have seen some dangerous developments in the past few weeks; it began with the dissolution of the sit-ins in Tahrir square and Maspiro by force, and continued when the military police stormed the Communications Faculty to break up the sit-in there also by force. Human rights organizations continue to issue numerous reports documenting acts of torture against detainees in military prisons, secret police headquarters, and the Egyptian museum. And amidst the media frenzy accusing the Egyptian laborers struggling for their rights of ruining the economy and disrupting stability, the military council hastily issues a draft law criminalizing civil disobedience and sit-ins. The danger of the situation increases when we fail to hold accountable those criminals known by name—who destroyed and burned down the Atfih Church, and others who lit a citizen’s house on fire in Qena and cut off his ear, only to have the military magistrate of Qena grant them formal reconciliation.,All of these crimes occur without anyone being held accountable, as if the goal were to intimidate citizens, inciting panic and horror among them.,The Military Council, which chose to rule the country itself in an ambiguous way, holds complete responsibility for how the country’s situation has deteriorated in recent weeks. The forces of the revolution demand that this unacceptable approach be brought to an end, and that everyone unite around a roadmap which guarantees a democratic transition through the following:,1. Bestowing political freedoms, chief among them the freedom to establish political parties, unions, and organizations by notification only.,2. Rebuilding the police apparatus as a civil body subject to civil and legal supervision, and holding accountable those individuals responsible for killing and torturing citizens.,3. Bringing the corrupt, those involved in forgery, and thieves of public funds to trial, and reclaiming the funds they stole.,4. Finding a realistic solution to urgent social demands, and dissolving the General Workers Union.,5. Dissolving local councils and district councils, and running new elections according to democratic principles.,6. Holding accountable the former press executives who misled the Egyptian people during the revolution.,7. Parliamentary elections through an open ‘mixed ballot’ system which guarantees actual representation for all political forces and independents, and which limits the influence of financial status and personal associations.,Together to Complete the Tasks of the Revolution..

The National Campaign:  Egypt Talks about Itself,2011-06-09,2011,"The National Campaign. Egypt Talks about Itself.,Know…Decide…Choose,The Civil State,Total equality between man and woman, Christian and Muslim, Sa‘idi [Egyptian from Upper Egypt] and fellah [peasant farmer], Bedouin and city-dweller, dark-skinned and fair-skinned. Everyone is united as long as everyone is Egyptian. This means that before the law everyone is equal despite their different origins, ideas, religion, sex, and color. Everyone also has equal freedoms, rights, and responsibilities. In this case we have three forms of government: the legislative, the executive and the judicial, with ultimate authority resting with the law. The transfer of power happens automatically and easily through the application of the Constitution and the law. This all means in the end that the most important component of the secular state is the individual/the citizen who is the axis and the basis for everything. This means absoluuuute respect for the principle of citizenship. So what does citizenship mean? Stay tuned, and we will tell you.,Citizenship,All of us live in the same place; we carry the same citizenship. We are thus individuals who belong to the same state, meaning we are citizens of a certain country. There are four basic values that citizenship entails:,Equality, Freedom, Fraternity, and Social Responsibility,Of course there are rights and responsibilities that are exchanged between a country and its citizen that rest on the idea of belonging.,If you would like to know more call us so that you know what your rights are and what is expected of you.,The Religious State,The term theocracy first appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages. This system was based on the idea that religious clergy were the shadow of God on the Earth and that they were those who controlled, judged, and granted forgiveness. The clergy were also the ones who had the power to grant rewards, to protect people, to forgive, and to punish. They were the religious authority in all matters. The people could not bear this idea so secularism, which was the idea of complete separation of church and state, appeared. The most important concept of secularism is that the clergy don’t have to understand politics; it is better if they do not have power in rule or in politics at all. An example of a theocracy in the modern age is Iran.,Liberalism,Simply, Liberalism means freedom and its goal is that the citizens and the whole society will be free from the restrictions of politics and economics. This means, for example, that every person can cast his vote in elections without any restrictions or censorship. As for economics, liberalism means the freedom to buy and sell and unrestricted competition between individuals and between organizations….Liberalism is also interested in the freedom of ideas, the importance of tolerance, respecting the dignity of each human being and securing his right in the society he lives in….It is also interested in emphasizing the role of the people in expressing their opinions through general referendums and the full separation between the executive, the legislative and judicial branches of government.,The Constitution,It is the basis or the collection of the founding principles which determine the structure of the state. It regulates the relationship between the ruler and the ruled and limits the power of the leadership. This means the constitution is the thing which tells us the responsibilities that are required of us and the rights that we have.,The Presidential System,This means that the president is the sole owner of executive power and it is his duty to protect the Constitution and the law and to enforce both of them. The cabinet, which he appoints, assists him in this task. It is within his rights to remove any member of the cabinet or even to dissolve the cabinet completely. The most famous example of the presidential system is America. We find their a complete separation of powers in the state; meaning the executive power is in the hands of the president, legislative power is in the hands of the Parliament and no one from one is able to interfere with the work of the other except in very limited instances.,The Parliamentary System,This means that executive power rests in the hands of the ministers who represent the government. It is the job of the Parliament to oversee the work of the government. The Parliament is able to withdraw its support for the government and remove it. The parliamentary system balances between the legislative and executive powers. As for the president it is a symbolic position, and his role is limited to matters of protocol and diplomatic meetings. In this system the government is put into office either by the people or the majority of ministers form a party which has more than half the members of parliament following the parliamentary elections. If no party is able to acquire a majority then the different parties form a coalition government from the parties in parliament. In all cases the government is held accountable by the Parliament for carrying out its duties.,For More,If you would like to contact us,Or if you have any questions or comments,(We are members together of the Campaign page on Facebook),Our page on Facebook’s name in Arabic is,(al-Hamla al-Wataniya – Misr Tatahaddith ‘an Nafsiha [The National Campaign.

The Nationalist Front for Justice and Democracy,2011-06-09,2011,"NATIONALIST FRONT FOR JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY,The Nationalist Front for Justice and Democracy was formed in Egypt in the aftermath of the January 25th Revolution to work towards realizing the revolution’s goals and cementing its gains in society. The Nationalist Front was founded after the noticeable increase in the danger of revolution’s momentum being exploited by numerous powers in Egypt that are pushing the revolution down paths opposed to the ambitions of the participants and the principles of the revolution itself. The most important of these powers include the remnants of the old regime, its political party, and its corrupt security organizations. They also include the centers of financial power and influence that were created in the age of the defunct regime, a number of opposition groups that are attempting to invest in the revolution in order to serve their own narrow interests, and the American-Zionist colonization and its collaborators.,Thus, the Nationalist Front was formed to challenge the dangerous plans of these powers by working to represent the interests of the popular majority that undertook the revolution and worked towards its success, especially after it became clear that more than 80% of the people that engaged in the events and activities of the revolution do not belong to any party or political organization – whether legitimate or otherwise – and do not have any platforms to represent their positions. Stemming from this, there is an ignorance of their views, interests, and rights in the process of forming a new country because they lack the organization of political platforms, and this situation causes serious difficulties for the principles of the revolution and a complete concealment of its merits. From this, the necessity of creating a new platform that unites this unrepresented majority and strives towards the realization of the goals upon which you all agree on became apparent. These goals are:,First: Implanting and Protecting Democracy,All signs indicate that the nascent democracy of January 25th will, regrettably, become distorted, profoundly lacking the components that give it resilience and stability. The process of democratic transition and the elections that it will produce are being planned and administered with an unjustified speed that will inevitably lead to the exclusion of everyone who is not politically organized, and will limit the available time for those people to organize themselves and defend their thoughts in a healthy democratic environment. This situation will consequently reduce their ability to compete with the more advanced and well-run organizations that existed on the scene before the revolution. Since the majority of those who undertook the revolution did not belong to any organizations that predate the revolution, the path has been closed to them, and as the excluded revolutionary majority, they have not been given the opportunity to present their views to society. Thus, the Nationalist Front will work to organize this majority in order to stabilize this democratic transition.,Second: Combating Corruption and Destroying its Structures,Everyone knows how widespread corruption is in Egypt and how rooted its structure is in all corners of the state and society. For this reason, confronting corruption and recovering looted money and resources have become two of the most important goals of the revolution and of Egyptian society generally, just as they are among the most important of the transitional regime’s stated goals. Regrettably, however, we have seen how the transitional regime has entrusted the old, pre-revolutionary surveillance and accountability apparatuses, which do not fall outside the realm of the corrupt relations that ran rampant in pre-revolutionary society, with holding the corrupt individuals accountable and returning what was looted from the state’s riches. Furthermore, the transitional regime’s delay in holding those corrupt individuals accountable and confronting corruption gives the corrupt a sufficient amount of time to organize their affairs, smuggle their money, and conceal incriminating evidence by shredding and burning, as we have seen. Thus, it is our responsibility to form popular, just, and effective frameworks to monitor corruption, hold the corrupt accountable, and seek the return of looted riches. The legitimacy and vitality of these frameworks derives from their popular support.,,Third: Achieving Social Justice,We have observed the indifference of political powers to – and even their criminalization of – the principle of social justice. This indifference is usually manifested in attacks not only on labor strikes but also on the interests of the poor. It is also manifested in the continuation of the same economic policies, which are biased towards the richest of the rich in Egypt, that the corrupt Mubarak regime pursued under the name of “Building Egypt” and returning vitality to the Egyptian economy. Thus, organized frameworks were formed in order to spread and defend a better understanding of social justice, as well as to create an acceptable picture of the means of achieving both social justice and new economic relations in society, both of which are believed to be urgently needed right now.,,Fourth: Working Towards Changing Domestic Policy, and Engagement in All Types of National Dialogue and Joint Projects,,It is our responsibility to start a healthy dialogue and work with all other political movements to form the best governmental, political, and constitutional environment for the coming period without excluding any side. We must strive to single out points of agreement and likely shared projects between the Nationalist Front and other political groups, just as we must coordinate our work with other political movements whenever possible.,,Fifth: Pressure for the Sake of an Independent, Patriotic Foreign Policy,,For centuries, Egypt has suffered colonial schemes that interfered in matters of governance, tyrannizing its people and resources. Contemporary colonialism has manifested itself through endorsing the corrupt client regime that supports the interests of foreign powers at the expense of the interests of the country and her citizens. In exchange for this endorsement, it keeps the client regime in power. For this reason, we must push for a foreign policy that works for Egypt by securing the interests of the country and its people, as well as the independence of the state, without groveling to or working for the interests of other states and peoples, as was the case in the past. Every national power must work to forbid the exploitation of the revolution to reproduce the same colonial system that corrupted the Egyptian state over the past four decades. They must also work to protect the nascent democracy from any such attempts if they hope to implement an independent, patriotic, free state that deals with the world only for the interests of its people.,,Sixth: Influencing the Results of the Elections as Much as Possible,,We must strive to put specific policies onto the electoral stage and participate in dialogue with the nominees to realize these policies in the different electoral programs of each nominee. We will support those who we consider to be in line with, and working to achieve, the goals of the Nationalist Front.,,Seventh: Achieving Security and Stability for the Country,,Restoring the stability and security of the country is a central goal which Egyptians are striving to achieve. Thus, we must publicly rebuild the police force with a new philosophy, specifically and explicitly different strategies, and a restructuring of this apparatus based on different basic principles.,Working Methods:,The Nationalist Front depends on numerous methods for realizing the previously mentioned goals. Here are some of the most important methods:,Popular Pressure,Popular pressure in its two most effective forms (protests and strikes) is a fundamental democratic right and a project for every person to undertake. Any attacks on this right, or attempts to snatch it away, are unacceptable. It is therefore necessary to defend the legitimacy of this right and the ability to practice it in complete freedom.,Media Pressure,We will work to create and deepen beneficial relationships with traditional media platforms, as well as establish alternative platforms, to spread the principles of the Nationalist Front and counter the regressive principles being spread by the counter-revolution.,Cultural Education and Spreading Awareness,We will rely on research and creativity in order to expose the critical issues that have been glossed over, distorted, or ignored, and spread useful information connected to the goals of the Nationalist Front – through projects, activities, and cutting-edge educational materials.,Geographic Expansion: Working on the Ground and in Various Sites,Media and fieldwork in the capital and large cities is not enough. We must overcome this usual focus and work with different groups, like unions, different groups of activists, intellectuals, artists, workers, etc. We must also strive to spread out geographically in the governorates and different areas.,INTERNAL ORGANIZATION,The Coordinating Committee,,The Coordinating Committee is the committee assigned to administer the affairs of the Nationalist Front and decide its policies in light of its public goals. The Coordinating Committee is composed of thirteen members who were the nucleus of the Front’s formation in addition to its founding members and representatives from the different governates in which public rules were developed for the Front. Nationalist Front members in each governate elect one member to represent them in the Coordinating Committee, which will be dissolved after the first parliamentary elections no later than September 2011. Elections to choose new members will be held according to rules decided on by the general membership of the Nationalist Front at that time.,Secretarial Committee,- Responsible for keeping and updating membership lists and financial records.,Committee for Political Analysis,- Reviews and studies the laws that involve the work and goals of the Nationalist Front,-Suggests adjustments, legal provisions, and constitutional provisions to support the goals of the Nationalist Front,- Prepares the required political analysis to sketch the orientations of the Nationalist Front and the campaigns it undertakes (the importance of the campaign and the contents of the political message to be spread),- Gathers the necessary information for campaigning and establishing the political stances of the Nationalist Front.,- Creates a map of different political powers that the Nationalist Front can employ in its various campaigns,Outreach Committee,- Coordinates between different specialized political groups on every initiative that is in line with the political orientations of the Nationalist Front,- Coordinates actions shared between different groups.,- Mobilizes and attracts different groups to adopt the political stances of the Nationalist Front through various events.,- Connects different political groups in various areas with the Popular Work Committee in those areas,,Media Committee,- Establishes and activates the Nationalist Front Page on the Internet and social networks,- Issues the page of the Nationalist Front,- Publishes news, events, and campaigns of the Nationalist Front,- Creates space for the news and opinions of the Nationalist Front in different froms of the media,- Prepares the media content (clips, posters, etc.) required for the campaigns of the Nationalist Front,Awareness and Popular Work Committee,- Organizes various events involving popular groups in different areas, with the goal of raising awareness about the Nationalist Front’s campaigns (such as popular meetings, debates between political representatives, the distribution of awareness materials, dialogue groups, artistic events, etc.),- Attracts new members to the Nationalist Front,- Directs the Committee for Political Analysis and the Outreach Committee towards questions that have currency on the street,- Distributes the media materials of the National Front (such as newspapers, posters, wall signs, etc) in different areas,,You can contact the Nationalist Front at:,Mobile: 01502223930,www.djabha.org,Facebook: The Nationalist Front for Justice and Democracy,Twitter: djabha,e-mail: info@djabha.org,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164034im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/National-Front-for-Justice-and-Democracy.png,imgID208,
"From Tahrir Square to the Alleys and Streets: The Experience of the Committee to Defend the Revolution in al-Ma’adi, al-Basatin, and Dar al-Salam",2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 4],From Tahrir Square to the Alleys and Streets,,The Experience of the Committee to Defend the Revolution in al-Ma’adi, al-Basatin, and Dar al-Salam,Organized political activity in the streets and neighborhoods was forbidden from the Egyptian people for decades as a result of successive governments’ repressive policies and repression of freedom. But the situation has changed thanks to the sacrifices of thousands of Egyptians during the revolution, which fractured—even if only temporarily—the tyranny and power of the police forces. Today we are able to carry out political work on the streets through conferences, marches, and statements as well people’s committees, which play an observatory role. In this article we will present the activities of one popular committee to defend the revolution—the committee of al-Ma’adi, al-Basatin, and Dar al-Salam—with the aim of sharing our experiences. This might be helpful to activists who want to form similar committees.,The Committee began its work shortly before Mubarak’s resignation on February 11, 2011. It organized its first public conference on al-Gumhuriyya Street in the popular neighborhood al-Ma’adi in order to honor the martyrs and discuss the post-revolution situation in Egypt. The Committee’s main message was to assure that the revolution would continue until its main slogan—“the people want the fall of the regime”—was brought to fruition. This meant not only Mubarak’s resignation, but also the fall of the legal and political system that caused widespread poverty and corruption throughout Egypt.,During the conference, a number of relatives of the martyrs from al-Ma’adi spoke. They made clear they did not want reparations but would prefer to see these murderers—foremost among them Mubarak—punished so that their martyrs’ blood will not have been shed in vain. For them, this punishment is crucial in achieving the hopes for which hundreds of Egypt’s sons were martyred. It was during this first conference that the Committee distributed its first statement, titled “The Revolution Continues.” Then the second statement, which emphasized the same idea, was distributed on the streets and in front of subway stations. It attempted to confront the counterattack which had developed at that time and which demanded calmness, patience, and a chance for Shafiq’s government.,The Committee’s second conference developed into something like a popular parliament. The people of ‘Ali ‘Abd al-’Aziz Street, near al-Ma’adi, spoke about their expectations for the revolution as well as their positions on Ahmad Shafiq’s government and the police forces. They were opposed to Shafiq remaining in office. There were a range of opinions among the local people; there were those who stressed the importance of continuing the revolution, and those who called for satisfaction with what was achieved, seeking a compromise. The majority opted to continue the revolution, thanks to a democratic dialogue in which Committee members’ participation was kept to a minimum. The people of the neighborhood did most of the talking.,On March 1st, a statement titled “Why organize a sit-in in Tahrir Square” was distributed widely among residents of al-Ma’adi as an answer to concerns about the sit-in at Tahrir Square. The statement clarified that demonstrating, staging sit-ins, and strikes are the only leverage the people have in order to achieve the revolution’s final goals. The Committee succeeded in convincing a number of the neighborhood’s inhabitants to participate in the sit-in, which ended with Shafiq’s government stepping down.,When an accident happened in al-Ma’adi, in which a microbus driver was shot in the neck by a police officer, a number of Committee members quickly participated in an unplanned vigil. On the same day, the Committee published a statement and distributed it widely. The statement’s main idea was that the police forces’ tyranny will continue as long as the criminals amongst them—the ones who tortured, injured, and killed thousands of Egyptians before and during the revolution—have not been and the National and Central Security Forces have not been dissolved. In the statement, we also demanded the resignation of the Interior Minister Mahmud Wagdy.,When sectarian events occurred at the Atfih church and in Manshiyat Nasir, the Committee hurried to publish a statement encouraging national unity against the revolution’s enemies: “Muslim… Christian… we all are Egyptians.” Similarly, the Committee successfully organized a demonstration march in support of national unity, together with hundreds of other neighborhoods. The march started in front of a mosque after Friday prayer and ended in front of a church.,As concerns its position on the constitutional amendments: the Committee organized its third public conference to discuss the amendments and explain its reasons for opposing the amendments. It also prepared three statements on this subject. Tens of thousand copies were handed out throughout the week before the referendum, in addition to posters rejecting the constitutional amendments. Several Committee members also took on roles as observers during the referendum.,During the one and a half months since the Committee to Defend the Revolution was founded, it has managed to organize three public conferences—each with an average participation of two hundred people—and a march attended by approximately five hundred citizens. It has published more than six statements—of which tens of thousands of copies were distributed—which provided the people of the neighborhood with an opportunity to enter into political discussions with the Committee members, the ones distributing the statements. This means that the political publicity successfully reached a high number of people in the neighborhood. This success led to the extension of our membership; what began as fewer than ten individuals ended up as a group with hundreds of members.,This is not to say that the Committee has not faced certain difficulties, among them: how to administer democratic dialogue amongst this growing membership, how to productively profit from these energies, how to raise funds for printing the statements and organizing the conferences. All of this has made us consider splitting up the Committee into specific groups, so that each can effectively accomplish its assigned duty.,(A group for public relations, a group for communication, memberships, and finances, a group for internet and publicity, a group for publishing and distributing the statements, a group for legal issues and research to study upcoming matters on the square, and a group which follows the issue of the injured and martyrs…),As it moves into a new phase, the Committee hopes to secure the people’s observatory role in the various national apparatuses (police districts, neighborhoods, provinces), helping them organize in a way that puts political pressure on these apparatuses, in order to guarantee that they carry out their duties and serve the citizens. The Committee will also continue to spread political consciousness during the parliamentary and presidential elections and in all matters that arise in the square.,","Logistics, Revolution, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144633im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled3.png,imgID209,
"Trial, Trial for the Gang That Was In Charge",2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 3],Trial, Trial for the Gang That Was In Charge,This slogan, shouted by revolutionaries throughout the revolution, has many deep meanings. It confirms that in the past Egypt was ruled by forming a gang dependent upon mingling money with power in order to support the machine of tyranny and oppression that sought to loot the nation’s goods and riches and deprive the people of their rights and opportunities for development.,As the slogan demands, the trial of every individual involved in this gang is one of the goals of the revolution upon which we will not give up.,However, up until today, fifty days after the fall of the president of this gang, neither he nor other senior members in the organization, such as his right-hand, Safwat al-Sharif, or his left-hand, Zakariya ‘Azmi, or the coordinator of political corruption, Fathi, have been brought to trial. Instead, the sacrifice has been made, just like as happens in the drug trade, of some novice boys, with the most honorable among the friends of the president’s son absorbing all of the public’s anger.,Despite the Prime Minister and the leaders of the Military Council’s certainty that there are schemes to abate and abort the revolution—beginning with the scene of “the camels and horses” and continuing until today—being carried out by elements of what is known as the counter-revolution, the leaders of these elements, who are the symbols of the corruption of the old guard, have been left behind to carry out their natural lives in spite of the charges leveled against them.,This suspicious laxity on behalf of the government and the army in the trials of Mubarak and the high-ups who helped him as well as the leadership of the National Party and the leaders of the dissolved State Security Forces has excited many interpretations. They begin with the role of Marshall Tantawi in guaranteeing them a safe exit from power, considering that he was counting on that wing of the previous old guard. People also say that the Gulf nations are exerting pressure and threatening to expel Egyptian workers if Mubarak is brought to trial, while others say that there is not a sufficient amount of evidence to convict them.,All of these theories and others like them ignore the role of this gang in corrupting political and social life and legalizing organized corruption and tyranny. Likewise, they also forget the legitimacy of the revolution, the price of which was paid by thousands of martyrs and wounded people, that requires the speedy trial of every element of corruption and tyranny. Leaving them at large currently represents the principle threat to the success of the revolution, the stability of the country, and the security of citizens. Capturing them and limiting their movements and their financial resources, for the sake of the people, is the only guaranteed way to send the rats of the counter-revolution back to their holes.,","Demands, Regime, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162017im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled5.png,imgID210,
The First Elected Dean on the ‘Ayn-Shams Arts Faculty… A Very Tough Task,2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 3],The First Elected Dean on the ‘Ayn-Shams Arts Faculty… A Very Tough Task,After a short battle, the Faculty of Arts at ‘Ayn-Shams University has witnessed the first election process for the position of dean. The most effective party in the election was the young members of the faculty, who insisted on their right to hold elections for the position of dean. Al-Dimati, who arrogantly left his position in order to take a job oversees, threw them out of the meeting hall, protesting that teaching assistants do not have the right to vote and that the elections for dean must be carried out by the teachers on the college board. By that, he meant, of course, the regime that was in place before 1989 of which he was not actually a contemporary. Under this pressure, which in the end was not escalated enough, the oldest teaching assistant was chosen to vote in the name of his co-workers.,“‘Abd al-Nasir Hasan,” a teacher in the Arabic Language Department and the first elected dean, has always enjoyed the respect of the entire teaching faculty, especially from the youth, even before his official nomination. Hasan faced a difficult campaign, as the bureaucracy of ‘Ayn Shams University has long been ruled by their security lords, more so than any other Egyptian university. Security forces are located at the head of the university, in the ultimate unveiling, and visits to the guard office are unavoidable in getting a position while near-constant visits from the guards to your office are inevitable if you want to keep your job.,Added to this is the generally poor academic condition that the university has reached, with the mafia of private lessons, required books, and even intellectual stagnation. This is the most difficult issue facing the university and it will not be easily resolved.,Perhaps the task most deserving of attention is the establishment of a democratic operation in the management of the university, without limiting voting privileges to senior faculty only but rather extending it to every member of the faculty and support staff—and not merely one delegate from the staff. Also at hand is their right to membership on college and department committees, where their representation should be proportional to their presence in each college and department.

This time, however, it occurred in a more repulsive fashion given the sanctity of the place in which this brutality occurred, the university campus, and because it was against peaceful protestors, who had taken care not to disrupt classes and decided to perform their sit-in outside of lecture hours. We all know that there has been a long fight to expel security from the university and respect the sanctity of this holy center of knowledge. After the January 25th Revolution, this dream was realized, but it quickly turned into a nightmare, given the position in which we find ourselves: We carried out a revolution in order to expel State Security, only to replace them with military police and their well-known electric baton, which reminds us of the baton of the Central Security Forces. Some might ask, “Well, how do you want them to break up the sit-in? Do you want them to break it up?” Our response is in compliance with the demands presented by the students, demands which were attacked with the word “classist” in order to insult and malign them. I was shocked when I heard the demands presented by the students described as “illegitimate”, despite the general lack of knowledge about them, for no one was interested in listening to these demands. Instead, they focused all their attention on their description as illegitimate and classist, how they were hampering the wheel of production and it was a kid’s game…etc. So let’s pose the question of the identity of those who determine the legitimacy of demands or lack thereof to researchers who deal with the source of legitimacy.,From my point of view, we carried out the revolution in order to lift away the guardianship of the regime so that we would determine our own path without needing someone to fill the role of the loving father who is afraid we’ll hurt ourselves with our recklessness. Consequently, we have emerged in order to present a group of demands whose only source of legitimacy lies in those who came out to demand them, and in spite of the lack of recognition from the regime—which represented the guardian—of these demands, their legitimacy was not destroyed. It was the duty of the Armed Forces not to interfere in the politics of the country, but after legitimacy was wrested from the political regime and bestowed upon the Armed Forces, their intervention and move to take over responsibility for the country became completely legitimate. Dissolving the legislature and creating constitutional amendments were not part of the Armed Forces’ powers, but they were capable of doing all of that based on a legitimacy that was itself based on the people.,In summary, they say that legitimacy is the legitimacy of the people, that it is something the people possess and that they alone can bestow upon who they wish. The people are the only measure by which legitimacy can be determined, enforced, or dispensed, and the system responsible for running the country has no duty other than synergizing the demands of the people and planning them out, then working to realize them using state resources owned by the people. By this same way of thinking, the source of legitimacy of the demands called “classist” is those who issue them and not the Armed Forces or the government. Of course, an employee at an insurance company would not determine the legitimacy of the demands from workers in a factory nor that of the demands from students in the College of Media.,In the case of those who ask for change solely for the sake of change without any wider understanding, forbidding people to make demands or beating them is not the solution. How easy it is for workers or students to not go to a rally and instead topple the institution by not going out and staying at home. Will this end in the passage of a law criminalizing staying at home?! The ideal solution is rational, logical dialogue and the establishment of a timetable for rational demands. As soon as these rational demands are realized the sit-in will be broken up. If this dialogue is carried out and the demands are treated rationally and impartially and the sit-in continues, contrary to the customs of the place, and it is being carried out only by the members of the original protesters and not an external faction unaware of the original group’s concerns, then in that case the demands lose their legitimacy for those who belong there and the sit-in should be broken up. However, this should take place in a humane way, without the involvement of the Ministry of the Interior or the Armed Forces but rather with the university’s civil security and under the supervision of rights groups, in order to prevent the occurrence of violations so that we learn a foundation of human respect. It seems that the members of the former regime were not the only ones ignoring this principle.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,Faysal, al-Haram, and al-’Amraniyya,,",Military,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160645im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled3.png,imgID212,
The Truth Behind Anti-Libyan Aggression,2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 2],The Truth Behind Anti-Libyan Aggression,We cannot designate what Libya is facing as anything but aggression, for how can we believe that world powers would protect the revolution? These regimes do not take action against any Arab dictator unless he stands in the way of their interests, and in our current state, dictators have become “burnt cards.”[1] World powers are leaving their dictator-clients to topple one after the other—first Ben ‘Ali and Mubarak, and now ‘Abdullah Salih and Qaddafi are on their way—after having granted these dictators many opportunities to repress their peoples’ revolutions, which they failed to do. The slogan “The people want the fall of the regime” became a demand that could be realized.,The goal was no longer for regimes to stay in power however bad they became, as long as they served the interests of the new imperialists, because the heads of these imperialist regimes had already fallen. Rather,the goal of the regimes that are currently being toppled was to remain in the best position possible, with the smallest number of changes, by arranging matters with the “New Rulers,” a.k.a. the generals, and by working to stop the revolutions on the threshold of a “Ballot Box Democracy.”,The logical and legitimate question is why, after all this time during which the blood of revolutionaries flowed and surprising victories were realized, the United States and its companions did not try to present military support or even humanitarian aid to the revolutionaries. This especially in light of Hillary Clinton’s visit to the new rulers of Egypt, and before her the Israeli Minister, who confirmed that, “All is well in the nation of the Nile,” and that, “If Mubarak left, one thousand Mubaraks could ride on the shoulders of the revolution.”,They are exploiting a huge propaganda machine to beautify their crimes, publishing pictures of Libyan revolutionaries raising the French flag while the truth is rooted in the confusion of a public born in the age of subjugation, desiring the end of this age by any means, and failing to believe that they themselves have nearly ended it. I recall that many people in Tahrir Square followed the American statements demanding the resignation of Mubarak with great interest, an example of the state of tension and confusion through which we passed.,The current scene reminds us of the American and European strikes on Iraq, and Egyptian forces’ participation. The only thing missing is Mubarak feigning tears in front of the camera, and Tantawi saying “Two sects of believers killed each other…” shamefully exploiting religion in order to justify an alliance with the Imperialist powers.,","Libya, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153344im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled6.png,imgID213,
March 30: A Day for Our Violated Lands,2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 2],March 30,A Day for Our Violated Lands,[words in beige graphic:] Here we will stay,The celebration of Yawm al-Ard (Earth Day) goes back to the 30th of March in 1976, when the Palestinian “Sons of the Nation” stood against the Israeli authorities in the lands that were occupied in 1948. They stood against the authorities that practiced various forms of repression and terrorism against them and deprived them of any right to expression or assembly. These authorities worked to conquer the greater portion of the land by any means, including the utter destruction of many villages, leaving Palestinians with no shelter or source of livelihood. Because of this pressure, which Palestinians living in the lands of ’48 endured for twenty-eight years, a popular outburst erupted in the form of a general strike and a rally. The Zionist occupation faced this outburst with excessive brutality, killing six (among them a woman), wounding dozens, and arresting more than three hundred people.,The spark that ignited Palestinian anger was the confiscation of 21,000 dunim (roughly 5,000 acres of land) from a number of Arab villages, and the designation of these villages for Zionist settlements under the banner of “The Plan for the Development of Galilee.” This plan was announced in 1975 and represented the fruition of a long plot to erase the identity of the Galilee region (Northern Palestine) by forcing Palestinian citizens to emigrate. Zionist authorities confiscated more than one million dunim of the Galilee and the Palestinian Triangle in the period from 1948 to 1972, in addition to millions of dunims that were seized by force, after a series of massacres, during the War of 1948.,Yawm al-Ard was the first Palestinian protest in the 1948 lands. In it, Palestinians used stones, axes, and knives against the authorities armed with machinery, guns, and gas canisters. Yawm al-Ard thereby became a day to express resistance and solidarity with the Arab identity of the land in all the Palestinian territories. Yawm al-Ard became a day to stand against the Western-Zionist media’s allegations that the Palestinians sold their own land, for statistics prove that the percentage of the land Zionists acquired by purchase was extremely tiny. They purchased this land using overly elaborate methods, such as seizing the lands of poor civilian farmers through real estate banks, or those of landowners who didn’t live in Palestine in the first place. Rather, they acquired the vast majority of their lands both with the help of the British Occupation and by force of arms.,","Palestine, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153053im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled4.png,imgID214,
Be Done With Your Old Union,2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 2],Be Done With Your Old Union,Public Transport Authority workers were able to disband their independent union, a fact which they announced at the Constituent Assembly that they convened last Friday, the 25th of March.,Public Transport workers suffered for many years from the deterioration of their social status and the lowering of their wages, while their union, adhering to the old regime’s policies, stood against their interests and opposed the actions they took to realize their legitimate demands. In spite of terrible pressure from security forces under the obsolete Mubarak regime, and the collusion of the union’s leader Hussayn Mugawur (a hero in the Battle of the Camels) with the regime and against the workers’ interests, the workers were able to organize a large strike on the 18th and 19th of August in 2009. This strike had a great impact on both the labor movement and the workers themselves, for it exposed the extent of the union’s extreme hostility towards the workers’ demands.,Three days before Mubarak’s resignation, the workers organized a strike involving all of the Transportation Authority’s garages. This strike, along with others, greatly contributed to making it impossible for Mubarak to remain in power.,Following in the footsteps of their colleagues in real estate taxes and the Pensions Union, Public Transport Authority workers decided to establish their own independent union to express their concerns, and in so doing struck a fatal blow to the remains of Mubarak’s and the businessmen’s unions. They did this so that the workers could practice their democratic right to choose their leaders on the ground directly, without waiting for an announcement from anyone, no matter whom.,In so doing, Public Transportation workers, like their colleagues in real estate tax reform, confirmed that democratic rights are taken and not given, and that laborers are also struggling for democracy in their own way.,On the same day, after the Public Transportation assembly, workers at Manshia Bakry General Hospital announced the establishment of the first independent guild in the medical sector, a guild whose membership encompasses both permanent and temporary workers.,Doctors, nurses, employees, and technicians — the guild includes all who work for a wage inside the hospital so that they can face their employer. With this powerful step, the workers’ guild at Manshia Bakri Hospital adheres to the true meaning of the guild structure, in which the guild expresses the interests of members regarding the employer, rather than the laborer and employee being in one guild together, as is the case in trade unions. For example, the doctors guild, unlike the Manshia workers’ guild, includes in its membership both the practicing doctor who fights for the improvement of his wages and the Minister of Health who owns the hospital in which the same doctor works.,With its actions, this guild broke down the surprising discrimination among trade and labor unions; in other words, returned the guild to its original, ideal state.,Long live the free, independent guilds,Long live the fight of the working class,,","Solidarity, Unions",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152947im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled4.png,imgID215,
False Reform,2011-06-08,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 5, Page 1],False Reform,From the first moments of the Egyptian revolution and following the revolutionaries’ success in toppling the dictator Mubarak, two visions have been butting heads in the Egyptian political street: gradual reform versus immediate, total, radical revolution to out the remnants of decay that have been accumulating for thirty years. Those that call for reform promote the idea that the revolution requires a transitional period in which power is transferred peacefully so that we move from subjugation to freedom, from dictatorship to democracy, and from the rule of an individual to rule of the people. These demands seem revolutionary, popular, and just, but they are accompanied by an apparent condition, which is stability. For the camp that calls for gradual reform believes that the revolution is now in urgent need of stability, just as it once needed the vociferous, mass labor movement in its first stage.,Under the call for stability, deceptive propaganda began describing social demands as calls to destruction that sought to damage the country’s economic interests. It also describes them as factional demands characterized by individualism and selfishness on the part of divided sectors of workers. These descriptions deliberately ignore the truth that these are the Egyptian general public’s demands. We have waited a long time, and it’s unacceptable to require that we wait any longer.,In truth, these calls for waiting and stability only serve the remnants of the former regime, protecting businessmen and the wealthy. Under no circumstances will they ever serve the workers’ and laborers’ interests. This became clear under Sharaf’s government, which promoted these calls on the basis that they are popular and derive their legitimacy from the square. Sharaf was careful to appoint ministers who were new faces, unknown to the masses—supporting the myth of change. But the government still administers the country’s affairs the same way even after the era of deposed tyrant. The government thus shows itself loyal, if only tacitly, to businessmen and capitalism, just as it is openly and blatantly hostile to the working class and the proletariat’s ranks. This was clearly manifested in the decree which Sharaf’s government approved, which criminalizes and prohibits strikes and labor sit-ins, and threatens those who participate in them with imprisonment and fines. Then the government deigned to clarify that it will allow for strikes in non-official work hours so that the process of production is not interrupted or harmed.,The only word with which to describe these governmental interpretations of the new law is that they are absurd. Sharaf’s government underestimates our intelligence before even considering our demands. Through these hostile behaviors towards workers and the masses, Sharaf’s government proves that it is little more than a partner to the revolution’s enemies from the previous regime, cooperating with them in attempt to suppress the revolution and steal victory from the people. It proves that this claim to stability is merely an opportunity for them to take a breath and organize their ranks to work once again, both aboveground and underground. It seems it is now our turn to explain to the Sharaf government and all those calling for stability and reform that the Egyptian revolution was not organized to topple Mubarak alone, but the entire regime. It was meant to enable us in bringing about true, democratic, radical change. The truth is that your calls for reform seem meager and insufficient in comparison to the revolution’s wealth and its radical promises. Indeed, the continuation of the revolution is the only path to meeting our social demands, our only guaranteed chance.,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152949im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled4.png,imgID216,

Jesus Loves You,2011-06-08,2011,"Jesus Loves You,On the platform at one of the stations, a little girl stands with her father, waiting close by. A man, arms in chains, catches her eye. Beside him is a policeman. She asks her father the reason for the chains. He tells her that this man is a criminal, sentenced to prison, and that he is on his way to serve his sentence. The girl felt terrible about this dire situation.,However, she cheered up in no time since she remembered what she had learned in Sunday School: the Lord Jesus loves sinners and came to save the wicked. So she asked her father’s permission and went over to that man, saying to him, “Hey mister, hey mister criminal! The Lord Jesus loves you!” But he drove her off angrily. Still, she went back to him a second time, repeating the same words, “The Lord Jesus loves you!” The man became furiously angry, and menacingly drove her off. So she turned back, having delivered her message.,The train came, and the girl returned home. The man went on his way to prison. There, in his dark room, he started going over the course of his past life, how the poison of sin had sidetracked him bit by bit so that he had finally reached this gaping chasm. While he was lamenting his bad luck and wretched life, the words reached into the depths of his soul, repeating the voice of the angels, “The Lord Jesus loves you.” The image of that pretty girl loomed before his eyes, her gentle voice saying, “The Lord Jesus loves you.” He yelled out, saying, “Who is this man that loves me? Everybody’s left me… Is there anyone who loves me?”,Just then, a voice rang out, singing, “Yes. The Lord Jesus loves you.”,However much he tried to get rid of the image, it only became more beautiful and more deeply influential until it took over his feelings and emotions. He screamed out from the depths of his soul as the weight of his sins broke his heart and tears of repentance filled his eyes, “Oh Jesus. Oh, he who loves me! Show yourself to me! As long as I refused Your call, I did not hear Your voice. But today I seek refuge in You, oh He who loves me!” All of a sudden, the light of the heavens brightened the darkness of his soul and shone upon the depths of his heart. “For in Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.”,Oh dear one, the eminent truth in the entirety of this existence is that God loves the sinner despite his disobedience and rebellion. The Lord Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost.,You are one of those for whom the Lord Jesus came. You may be cultured and pleasant so that everyone will say good things about you. The scale of sin with God, however, differs from the scale of people. You may say, “I am not a sinner like this man or that one, for I am not a murderer, a thief, or etc.” However, you are, in the eyes of God, a sinner and deserving of terrible judgment because you disobey His Commandments. He who commits sin is a slave to sin.,However, I bring glad tidings, for as much as you may have sinned, and however great your transgressions, the Lord wants to save you and be merciful to you, for the Lord Jesus loves you.,Yes! He loves you, and He has been patient with you until now. Many diseases may harm you, but the Lord will save you from them. He does not want you to perish for your sins, for the Lord Jesus loves you. You may pass through difficult circumstances, but the Lord will save you from them. He does not want the sun to set on your life while you are lost in sin because the Lord Jesus loves you.,Many dangers surrounded you, and among them you were close to death. Still, the Lord saved you from them so that you did not die in your evil and disobedience because the Lord Jesus loves you.,He does not love you with words, but He gave Himself for your sake on the cross to pay the debts of your sin and free you from its power, to instill in your heart a new nature, allowing you to walk in righteousness and holiness. You need only lift up your heart in repentance and belief, acknowledging your sins so that you make room for the voice of God, “Take courage, my son, your sins are forgiven.”,If only, oh dear one, you could free yourself and be rightly guided—even just a little—before the Lord, your God. If only you would think seriously about the love Jesus has for you, for not even the fires of Hell and the suffering on the cross could stand in the way of this love. It is for your sake, and out of love for you, that He willingly chose to hang on the cross, wounded for your sins and crushed for your transgressions. That while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, “There is no greater love than this, that He lay down His life for those He loved.”,Oh dear one, if you forget everything else, do not forget that “the Lord Jesus loves you.” Yes.

This became clear under Sharaf’s government, which promoted these calls on the basis that they are popular and derive their legitimacy from the square. Sharaf was careful to appoint ministers who were new faces, unknown to the masses—supporting the myth of change. But the government still administers the country’s affairs the same way even after the era of deposed tyrant. The government thus shows itself loyal, if only tacitly, to businessmen and capitalism, just as it is openly and blatantly hostile to the working class and the proletariat’s ranks. This was clearly manifested in the decree which Sharaf’s government approved, which criminalizes and prohibits strikes and labor sit-ins, and threatens those who participate in them with imprisonment and fines. Then the government deigned to clarify that it will allow for strikes in non-official work hours so that the process of production is not interrupted or harmed.,The only word with which to describe these governmental interpretations of the new law is that they are absurd. Sharaf’s government underestimates our intelligence before even considering our demands. Through these hostile behaviors towards workers and the masses, Sharaf’s government proves that it is little more than a partner to the revolution’s enemies from the previous regime, cooperating with them in attempt to suppress the revolution and steal victory from the people. It proves that this claim to stability is merely an opportunity for them to take a breath and organize their ranks to work once again, both aboveground and underground. It seems it is now our turn to explain to the Sharaf government and all those calling for stability and reform that the Egyptian revolution was not organized to topple Mubarak alone, but the entire regime. It was meant to enable us in bringing about true, democratic, radical change. The truth is that your calls for reform seem meager and insufficient in comparison to the revolution’s wealth and its radical promises. Indeed, the continuation of the revolution is the only path to meeting our social demands, our only guaranteed chance.,,Page 2,Be Done With Your Old Union,Public Transport Authority workers were able to disband their independent union, a fact which they announced at the Constituent Assembly that they convened last Friday, the 25th of March.,Public Transport workers suffered for many years from the deterioration of their social status and the lowering of their wages, while their union, adhering to the old regime’s policies, stood against their interests and opposed the actions they took to realize their legitimate demands. In spite of terrible pressure from security forces under the obsolete Mubarak regime, and the collusion of the union’s leader Hussayn Mugawur (a hero in the Battle of the Camels) with the regime and against the workers’ interests, the workers were able to organize a large strike on the 18th and 19th of August in 2009. This strike had a great impact on both the labor movement and the workers themselves, for it exposed the extent of the union’s extreme hostility towards the workers’ demands.,Three days before Mubarak’s resignation, the workers organized a strike involving all of the Transportation Authority’s garages. This strike, along with others, greatly contributed to making it impossible for Mubarak to remain in power.,Following in the footsteps of their colleagues in real estate taxes and the Pensions Union, Public Transport Authority workers decided to establish their own independent union to express their concerns, and in so doing struck a fatal blow to the remains of Mubarak’s and the businessmen’s unions. They did this so that the workers could practice their democratic right to choose their leaders on the ground directly, without waiting for an announcement from anyone, no matter whom.,In so doing, Public Transportation workers, like their colleagues in real estate tax reform, confirmed that democratic rights are taken and not given, and that laborers are also struggling for democracy in their own way.,On the same day, after the Public Transportation assembly, workers at Manshia Bakry General Hospital announced the establishment of the first independent guild in the medical sector, a guild whose membership encompasses both permanent and temporary workers.,Doctors, nurses, employees, and technicians — the guild includes all who work for a wage inside the hospital so that they can face their employer. With this powerful step, the workers’ guild at Manshia Bakri Hospital adheres to the true meaning of the guild structure, in which the guild expresses the interests of members regarding the employer, rather than the laborer and employee being in one guild together, as is the case in trade unions. For example, the doctors guild, unlike the Manshia workers’ guild, includes in its membership both the practicing doctor who fights for the improvement of his wages and the Minister of Health who owns the hospital in which the same doctor works.,With its actions, this guild broke down the surprising discrimination among trade and labor unions; in other words, returned the guild to its original, ideal state.,Long live the free, independent guilds,Long live the fight of the working class,March 30,A Day for Our Violated Lands,[words in beige graphic:] Here we will stay,The celebration of Yawm al-Ard (Earth Day) goes back to the 30th of March in 1976, when the Palestinian “Sons of the Nation” stood against the Israeli authorities in the lands that were occupied in 1948. They stood against the authorities that practiced various forms of repression and terrorism against them and deprived them of any right to expression or assembly. These authorities worked to conquer the greater portion of the land by any means, including the utter destruction of many villages, leaving Palestinians with no shelter or source of livelihood. Because of this pressure, which Palestinians living in the lands of ’48 endured for twenty-eight years, a popular outburst erupted in the form of a general strike and a rally. The Zionist occupation faced this outburst with excessive brutality, killing six (among them a woman), wounding dozens, and arresting more than three hundred people.,The spark that ignited Palestinian anger was the confiscation of 21,000 dunim (roughly 5,000 acres of land) from a number of Arab villages, and the designation of these villages for Zionist settlements under the banner of “The Plan for the Development of Galilee.” This plan was announced in 1975 and represented the fruition of a long plot to erase the identity of the Galilee region (Northern Palestine) by forcing Palestinian citizens to emigrate. Zionist authorities confiscated more than one million dunim of the Galilee and the Palestinian Triangle in the period from 1948 to 1972, in addition to millions of dunims that were seized by force, after a series of massacres, during the War of 1948.,Yawm al-Ard was the first Palestinian protest in the 1948 lands. In it, Palestinians used stones, axes, and knives against the authorities armed with machinery, guns, and gas canisters. Yawm al-Ard thereby became a day to express resistance and solidarity with the Arab identity of the land in all the Palestinian territories. Yawm al-Ard became a day to stand against the Western-Zionist media’s allegations that the Palestinians sold their own land, for statistics prove that the percentage of the land Zionists acquired by purchase was extremely tiny. They purchased this land using overly elaborate methods, such as seizing the lands of poor civilian farmers through real estate banks, or those of landowners who didn’t live in Palestine in the first place. Rather, they acquired the vast majority of their lands both with the help of the British Occupation and by force of arms.,The Truth Behind Anti-Libyan Aggression,We cannot designate what Libya is facing as anything but aggression, for how can we believe that world powers would protect the revolution? These regimes do not take action against any Arab dictator unless he stands in the way of their interests, and in our current state, dictators have become “burnt cards.”[1] World powers are leaving their dictator-clients to topple one after the other—first Ben ‘Ali and Mubarak, and now ‘Abdullah Salih and Qaddafi are on their way—after having granted these dictators many opportunities to repress their peoples’ revolutions, which they failed to do. The slogan “The people want the fall of the regime” became a demand that could be realized.,The goal was no longer for regimes to stay in power however bad they became, as long as they served the interests of the new imperialists, because the heads of these imperialist regimes had already fallen. Rather,the goal of the regimes that are currently being toppled was to remain in the best position possible, with the smallest number of changes, by arranging matters with the “New Rulers,” a.k.a. the generals, and by working to stop the revolutions on the threshold of a “Ballot Box Democracy.”,The logical and legitimate question is why, after all this time during which the blood of revolutionaries flowed and surprising victories were realized, the United States and its companions did not try to present military support or even humanitarian aid to the revolutionaries. This especially in light of Hillary Clinton’s visit to the new rulers of Egypt, and before her the Israeli Minister, who confirmed that, “All is well in the nation of the Nile,” and that, “If Mubarak left, one thousand Mubaraks could ride on the shoulders of the revolution.”,They are exploiting a huge propaganda machine to beautify their crimes, publishing pictures of Libyan revolutionaries raising the French flag while the truth is rooted in the confusion of a public born in the age of subjugation, desiring the end of this age by any means, and failing to believe that they themselves have nearly ended it. I recall that many people in Tahrir Square followed the American statements demanding the resignation of Mubarak with great interest, an example of the state of tension and confusion through which we passed.,The current scene reminds us of the American and European strikes on Iraq, and Egyptian forces’ participation. The only thing missing is Mubarak feigning tears in front of the camera, and Tantawi saying “Two sects of believers killed each other…” shamefully exploiting religion in order to justify an alliance with the Imperialist powers.,,Page 3,,The Army, the People, and Revolutionary Legitimacy,Only about two weeks after the military police broke up the sit-in in Tahrir Square using violence and deliberate hostility towards the peaceful protesters, the scene repeated itself. This time, however, it occurred in a more repulsive fashion given the sanctity of the place in which this brutality occurred, the university campus, and because it was against peaceful protestors, who had taken care not to disrupt classes and decided to perform their sit-in outside of lecture hours. We all know that there has been a long fight to expel security from the university and respect the sanctity of this holy center of knowledge. After the January 25th Revolution, this dream was realized, but it quickly turned into a nightmare, given the position in which we find ourselves: We carried out a revolution in order to expel State Security, only to replace them with military police and their well-known electric baton, which reminds us of the baton of the Central Security Forces. Some might ask, “Well, how do you want them to break up the sit-in? Do you want them to break it up?” Our response is in compliance with the demands presented by the students, demands which were attacked with the word “classist” in order to insult and malign them. I was shocked when I heard the demands presented by the students described as “illegitimate”, despite the general lack of knowledge about them, for no one was interested in listening to these demands. Instead, they focused all their attention on their description as illegitimate and classist, how they were hampering the wheel of production and it was a kid’s game…etc. So let’s pose the question of the identity of those who determine the legitimacy of demands or lack thereof to researchers who deal with the source of legitimacy.,From my point of view, we carried out the revolution in order to lift away the guardianship of the regime so that we would determine our own path without needing someone to fill the role of the loving father who is afraid we’ll hurt ourselves with our recklessness. Consequently, we have emerged in order to present a group of demands whose only source of legitimacy lies in those who came out to demand them, and in spite of the lack of recognition from the regime—which represented the guardian—of these demands, their legitimacy was not destroyed. It was the duty of the Armed Forces not to interfere in the politics of the country, but after legitimacy was wrested from the political regime and bestowed upon the Armed Forces, their intervention and move to take over responsibility for the country became completely legitimate. Dissolving the legislature and creating constitutional amendments were not part of the Armed Forces’ powers, but they were capable of doing all of that based on a legitimacy that was itself based on the people.,In summary, they say that legitimacy is the legitimacy of the people, that it is something the people possess and that they alone can bestow upon who they wish. The people are the only measure by which legitimacy can be determined, enforced, or dispensed, and the system responsible for running the country has no duty other than synergizing the demands of the people and planning them out, then working to realize them using state resources owned by the people. By this same way of thinking, the source of legitimacy of the demands called “classist” is those who issue them and not the Armed Forces or the government. Of course, an employee at an insurance company would not determine the legitimacy of the demands from workers in a factory nor that of the demands from students in the College of Media.,In the case of those who ask for change solely for the sake of change without any wider understanding, forbidding people to make demands or beating them is not the solution. How easy it is for workers or students to not go to a rally and instead topple the institution by not going out and staying at home. Will this end in the passage of a law criminalizing staying at home?! The ideal solution is rational, logical dialogue and the establishment of a timetable for rational demands. As soon as these rational demands are realized the sit-in will be broken up. If this dialogue is carried out and the demands are treated rationally and impartially and the sit-in continues, contrary to the customs of the place, and it is being carried out only by the members of the original protesters and not an external faction unaware of the original group’s concerns, then in that case the demands lose their legitimacy for those who belong there and the sit-in should be broken up. However, this should take place in a humane way, without the involvement of the Ministry of the Interior or the Armed Forces but rather with the university’s civil security and under the supervision of rights groups, in order to prevent the occurrence of violations so that we learn a foundation of human respect. It seems that the members of the former regime were not the only ones ignoring this principle.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,Faysal, al-Haram, and al-’Amraniyya,The First Elected Dean on the ‘Ayn-Shams Arts Faculty… A Very Tough Task,After a short battle, the Faculty of Arts at ‘Ayn-Shams University has witnessed the first election process for the position of dean. The most effective party in the election was the young members of the faculty, who insisted on their right to hold elections for the position of dean. Al-Dimati, who arrogantly left his position in order to take a job oversees, threw them out of the meeting hall, protesting that teaching assistants do not have the right to vote and that the elections for dean must be carried out by the teachers on the college board. By that, he meant, of course, the regime that was in place before 1989 of which he was not actually a contemporary. Under this pressure, which in the end was not escalated enough, the oldest teaching assistant was chosen to vote in the name of his co-workers.,“‘Abd al-Nasir Hasan,” a teacher in the Arabic Language Department and the first elected dean, has always enjoyed the respect of the entire teaching faculty, especially from the youth, even before his official nomination. Hasan faced a difficult campaign, as the bureaucracy of ‘Ayn Shams University has long been ruled by their security lords, more so than any other Egyptian university. Security forces are located at the head of the university, in the ultimate unveiling, and visits to the guard office are unavoidable in getting a position while near-constant visits from the guards to your office are inevitable if you want to keep your job.,Added to this is the generally poor academic condition that the university has reached, with the mafia of private lessons, required books, and even intellectual stagnation. This is the most difficult issue facing the university and it will not be easily resolved.,Perhaps the task most deserving of attention is the establishment of a democratic operation in the management of the university, without limiting voting privileges to senior faculty only but rather extending it to every member of the faculty and support staff—and not merely one delegate from the staff. Also at hand is their right to membership on college and department committees, where their representation should be proportional to their presence in each college and department. I see this as a guarantee of the achievement of true reform for all of the university’s problems and a guarantee of maintaining these reforms and facing down the previous regime, which maintained an unusual presence in the university.,Assistant Lecturer – College of Arts, ‘Ayn Shams University,Trial, Trial for the Gang That Was In Charge,This slogan, shouted by revolutionaries throughout the revolution, has many deep meanings. It confirms that in the past Egypt was ruled by forming a gang dependent upon mingling money with power in order to support the machine of tyranny and oppression that sought to loot the nation’s goods and riches and deprive the people of their rights and opportunities for development.,As the slogan demands, the trial of every individual involved in this gang is one of the goals of the revolution upon which we will not give up.,However, up until today, fifty days after the fall of the president of this gang, neither he nor other senior members in the organization, such as his right-hand, Safwat al-Sharif, or his left-hand, Zakariya ‘Azmi, or the coordinator of political corruption, Fathi, have been brought to trial. Instead, the sacrifice has been made, just like as happens in the drug trade, of some novice boys, with the most honorable among the friends of the president’s son absorbing all of the public’s anger.,Despite the Prime Minister and the leaders of the Military Council’s certainty that there are schemes to abate and abort the revolution—beginning with the scene of “the camels and horses” and continuing until today—being carried out by elements of what is known as the counter-revolution, the leaders of these elements, who are the symbols of the corruption of the old guard, have been left behind to carry out their natural lives in spite of the charges leveled against them.,This suspicious laxity on behalf of the government and the army in the trials of Mubarak and the high-ups who helped him as well as the leadership of the National Party and the leaders of the dissolved State Security Forces has excited many interpretations. They begin with the role of Marshall Tantawi in guaranteeing them a safe exit from power, considering that he was counting on that wing of the previous old guard. People also say that the Gulf nations are exerting pressure and threatening to expel Egyptian workers if Mubarak is brought to trial, while others say that there is not a sufficient amount of evidence to convict them.,All of these theories and others like them ignore the role of this gang in corrupting political and social life and legalizing organized corruption and tyranny. Likewise, they also forget the legitimacy of the revolution, the price of which was paid by thousands of martyrs and wounded people, that requires the speedy trial of every element of corruption and tyranny. Leaving them at large currently represents the principle threat to the success of the revolution, the stability of the country, and the security of citizens. Capturing them and limiting their movements and their financial resources, for the sake of the people, is the only guaranteed way to send the rats of the counter-revolution back to their holes.,,Page 4,From Tahrir Square to the Alleys and Streets,,The Experience of the Committee to Defend the Revolution in al-Ma’adi, al-Basatin, and Dar al-Salam,Organized political activity in the streets and neighborhoods was forbidden from the Egyptian people for decades as a result of successive governments’ repressive policies and repression of freedom. But the situation has changed thanks to the sacrifices of thousands of Egyptians during the revolution, which fractured—even if only temporarily—the tyranny and power of the police forces. Today we are able to carry out political work on the streets through conferences, marches, and statements as well people’s committees, which play an observatory role. In this article we will present the activities of one popular committee to defend the revolution—the committee of al-Ma’adi, al-Basatin, and Dar al-Salam—with the aim of sharing our experiences. This might be helpful to activists who want to form similar committees.,The Committee began its work shortly before Mubarak’s resignation on February 11, 2011. It organized its first public conference on al-Gumhuriyya Street in the popular neighborhood al-Ma’adi in order to honor the martyrs and discuss the post-revolution situation in Egypt. The Committee’s main message was to assure that the revolution would continue until its main slogan—“the people want the fall of the regime”—was brought to fruition. This meant not only Mubarak’s resignation, but also the fall of the legal and political system that caused widespread poverty and corruption throughout Egypt.,During the conference, a number of relatives of the martyrs from al-Ma’adi spoke. They made clear they did not want reparations but would prefer to see these murderers—foremost among them Mubarak—punished so that their martyrs’ blood will not have been shed in vain. For them, this punishment is crucial in achieving the hopes for which hundreds of Egypt’s sons were martyred. It was during this first conference that the Committee distributed its first statement, titled “The Revolution Continues.” Then the second statement, which emphasized the same idea, was distributed on the streets and in front of subway stations. It attempted to confront the counterattack which had developed at that time and which demanded calmness, patience, and a chance for Shafiq’s government.,The Committee’s second conference developed into something like a popular parliament. The people of ‘Ali ‘Abd al-’Aziz Street, near al-Ma’adi, spoke about their expectations for the revolution as well as their positions on Ahmad Shafiq’s government and the police forces. They were opposed to Shafiq remaining in office. There were a range of opinions among the local people; there were those who stressed the importance of continuing the revolution, and those who called for satisfaction with what was achieved, seeking a compromise. The majority opted to continue the revolution, thanks to a democratic dialogue in which Committee members’ participation was kept to a minimum. The people of the neighborhood did most of the talking.,On March 1st, a statement titled “Why organize a sit-in in Tahrir Square” was distributed widely among residents of al-Ma’adi as an answer to concerns about the sit-in at Tahrir Square. The statement clarified that demonstrating, staging sit-ins, and strikes are the only leverage the people have in order to achieve the revolution’s final goals. The Committee succeeded in convincing a number of the neighborhood’s inhabitants to participate in the sit-in, which ended with Shafiq’s government stepping down.,When an accident happened in al-Ma’adi, in which a microbus driver was shot in the neck by a police officer, a number of Committee members quickly participated in an unplanned vigil. On the same day, the Committee published a statement and distributed it widely. The statement’s main idea was that the police forces’ tyranny will continue as long as the criminals amongst them—the ones who tortured, injured, and killed thousands of Egyptians before and during the revolution—have not been and the National and Central Security Forces have not been dissolved. In the statement, we also demanded the resignation of the Interior Minister Mahmud Wagdy.,When sectarian events occurred at the Atfih church and in Manshiyat Nasir, the Committee hurried to publish a statement encouraging national unity against the revolution’s enemies: “Muslim… Christian… we all are Egyptians.” Similarly, the Committee successfully organized a demonstration march in support of national unity, together with hundreds of other neighborhoods. The march started in front of a mosque after Friday prayer and ended in front of a church.,As concerns its position on the constitutional amendments: the Committee organized its third public conference to discuss the amendments and explain its reasons for opposing the amendments. It also prepared three statements on this subject. Tens of thousand copies were handed out throughout the week before the referendum, in addition to posters rejecting the constitutional amendments. Several Committee members also took on roles as observers during the referendum.,During the one and a half months since the Committee to Defend the Revolution was founded, it has managed to organize three public conferences—each with an average participation of two hundred people—and a march attended by approximately five hundred citizens. It has published more than six statements—of which tens of thousands of copies were distributed—which provided the people of the neighborhood with an opportunity to enter into political discussions with the Committee members, the ones distributing the statements. This means that the political publicity successfully reached a high number of people in the neighborhood. This success led to the extension of our membership; what began as fewer than ten individuals ended up as a group with hundreds of members.,This is not to say that the Committee has not faced certain difficulties, among them: how to administer democratic dialogue amongst this growing membership, how to productively profit from these energies, how to raise funds for printing the statements and organizing the conferences. All of this has made us consider splitting up the Committee into specific groups, so that each can effectively accomplish its assigned duty.,(A group for public relations, a group for communication, memberships, and finances, a group for internet and publicity, a group for publishing and distributing the statements, a group for legal issues and research to study upcoming matters on the square, and a group which follows the issue of the injured and martyrs…),As it moves into a new phase, the Committee hopes to secure the people’s observatory role in the various national apparatuses (police districts, neighborhoods, provinces), helping them organize in a way that puts political pressure on these apparatuses, in order to guarantee that they carry out their duties and serve the citizens. The Committee will also continue to spread political consciousness during the parliamentary and presidential elections and in all matters that arise in the square.,To Contact, Join, and Give Your Suggestions,Facebook: al-Ligan al-Sha’biyya li-l-Difa’ ‘an al-Thawra al-Misriyya [The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Egyptian Revolution],Blog: http://leganthawrya.blogspot.com,E-mail: Leganthawrya@yahoo.com,[Logo text: The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution],Central Telephone: [redacted],al-Haram- Faysal- al-‘Umaraniyya: [redacted],Bulaq al-Dakrur: [redacted],al-Ma‘adi – al-Basatin – Dar al-Salam: [redacted],Imbaba: [redacted],al-Jamaliyya: [redacted],al-Sayyida Zaynab: [redacted],al-Shaykh Zayid – 6 October: [redacted],Shubra: [redacted],al-Qanatir al-Khayriyya: [redacted],East Cairo: [redacted],al-Saff – al-Badrashin – al-Hawamdiyya: [redacted],Alexandria: [redacted],al-Sharqiyya: [redacted],al-Isma‘iliyya: [redacted],Port Sa‘id: [redacted],Kafr al-Shaykh : [redacted],al-Fayum: [redacted],Asyut: [redacted],Bani Suwayf: [redacted],,[1] This is an expression that means “obsolete,” similar to “old news” in English.,","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144827im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled2.png,imgID219,

The Popular Democratic Movement,2011-06-04,2011,",In fundamental agreement with the plan Mubarak presented before stepping down to stifle the rising revolution, the upcoming March 19th has been set as the date for the people’s referendum to amend some articles of the current Constitution. This Constitution was prepared by the committee that the ruling Military Council supervised under the chairmanship of Tariq al-Bishri.,The movement announces its refusal of these amendments and calls upon the children of the people, the powers of the revolution, and democracy to refuse them. In principle, the movement considers the amendments to be a way to liquidate the revolution and enable the dominant class and its political representatives to regain authority. The amendments include speeding up the presidential and legislative electoral process before the transitional period achieves any of the revolutionary missions: most importantly, lifting restrictions on democratic freedom, providing sufficient time to present speeches and political programs, and familiarizing the people with them and their leadership. These amendments will necessarily make available the best opportunities for the victory of the remnants of the “National” Party, the Brotherhood, and other faces representing the dominant class that controls wealth and state power with a sweeping majority in Parliament in addition to the position of the President.,With emphasis on the initial refusal of the suspicious plan to change the Constitution mentioned above, our movement registers it’s rejection of what these amendments would result in: strengthening the High Council for Presidential Elections, which is an administrative council, by preventing appeals to its decisions; keeping the Shura Council, although our country has no need for a council that is only found in some countries of the world in order to represent a diverse range of ethnicities and nationalities, the aristocracy as it was before 1952, or those being groomed for governing, as was the case with the regime’s Council which provoked the people to topple it; the selection of the Drafting Committee that will be entrusted with preparing a new Constitution (100 members) with the mediation of the members of the next People’s Assembly and the Shura Council instead of electing it directly by the people; and there are other amendments inconsistent with our people’s ambition for freedom and democracy such as the appointment of the Vice President rather than his election, the preservation of the tyranny of presidential powers, and others.,Let the true power of the January 25th revolution be unified by refusing the above mentioned constitutional amendments and deferring any parliamentary or presidential elections pending the release of all freedoms and making available the necessary time for the people to be familiarized with true representatives after long decades which saw the liquidation of their parties and hard-working trade union organizations. Let us wait at least one year after the removal of all restrictions on democratic freedoms for the Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution for a parliamentary republic, until the completion of the transitional period’s tasks other than that can serve as a trial for the heads of corruption and those who committed crimes of violence and torture, firing on the sons and daughters of the people. We must wait for the retrieval of properties stolen by the state, as well as the factories that were given to the Egyptian or foreign private sectors without justification.,May the constitutional amendments which oppose the people’s revolution fail.

To where?,Dr. Salah al-Din al-Dusuki,In the previous article, we dealt with the issue of wages as it is a pillar of social justice. This requires putting in place a minimum wage and a wage system which increases productivity and achieves justice. We ended by discussing the fears of some people that increased wages will lead to a state of inflation in which high prices would offset any increase in wages and instead change into a reduction in the actual value of wages regarding what they are able to get as far as good and services.,The Egyptian markets witnessed successive increases in prices during the last 40 years that often exceeded the increases in wages. This led to a sharp increase in poverty until more than half the Egyptians fell below the poverty line. The regime of Sadat, and his successor Mubarak, adopted the free economy policy that was implemented by giving businessmen the complete authority to control prices and create monopolies in the industrial and commercial sectors in both wholesale and retail trade. Consumers became prey to the greediness and quick profit of a group circling the official state institutions. These overnight billionaires ended up falling between the hands of justice after the January 25th Revolution. We note with concern that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the government have stuck to this policy, a corner stone of the fallen regime. It is not that easy to briefly discuss the contradiction between social justice and the free market. This policy failed to improve the Egyptian economy for nearly forty years, and we are sure this is what led to the social and economic catastrophe that was about to shake the nation’s foundation.,The revolution will not be a real one unless the government interferes with prices by using a variety of tools, ranging from pricing constraints to pricing guidelines to the use of public sector distribution points to determining profit margins. There are techniques and outcomes related to each of these tools, just as they are in need of mechanisms for their application.,We know the extent of rejection that these proposals face from the political and economic elite.

Program of the Democratic Workers Party,2011-07-30,2011,"Program of the Democratic Workers Party,Freedom – Dignity – Humanity – Social Justice,,Preamble to the Party’s Draft Program,,The document in your hands is the draft program of the Workers Party. It is the result of discussions, carried out by groups of the party’s founders in different places, recording their thoughts on basic principles as well as their ideas for a new revolutionary Egypt, which must come into being after our people’s revolution on 25 January 2011.,We present this draft to all Egyptian workers, farmers, politicians, intellectuals, students, and to everyone who wishes to join the party’s ranks and to defend the laborers’ interests. It is up to every member to contribute his opinion and expertise in order to develop this program, for it is ready for amendment, discussion, additions, and deletions. The platform will only become final after its confirmation by the party’s first founding congress and will not be changed except during the party’s second congress.,In every corner of Egypt, Egyptian workers participated in all national struggles. They actively joined in the 1919 revolution and struggled against the English occupation. They opposed the oppression of the authorities and the regime oppression, starting with the tobacco workers’ strike of 1899 until their latest strike during the revolution of 25 January 2011.,The history of the Egyptian workers’ struggle is a history we should be proud of and from which we borrow its experience and lessons against all the ranks of exploitation and class oppression.,The Egyptian workers’ struggle during the 1919 revolution, and their struggle to form a national Workers’ and Student’s Committee in 1946, and their constant struggle against capitalist exploitation are venerable examples. The Mahalla al-Kubra uprising of 6 April 2008, and the workers’ strikes, protests, and sit-ins which went on from December 2006 till now: these were a natural prelude to the revolution of 25 January.,The workers bore much oppression during their history, not only by their main enemy (exploitive capitalism), but also by the repressive state apparatus and the colonialists. The Egyptian working class gave many of their children as martyrs, injured, detainees, and as prisoners of conscience.,The workers were always at the vanguard. And the Workers Party remained dreaming of attracting the most devoted workers. The working class did not despair of realizing the dream, but began to demand it, trying to find a place for it in the shade of the darkest conditions and the utmost oppression, corruption, and tyranny until the dawn of freedom and revolution broke. For it brought light to the darkness of the night and tyranny and toppled the regime, and the realization of the dream was inevitable.,,Our Party,,Our party’s identity is labor .. Our party is a political party striving to achieve freedom, democracy, human dignity, and social justice .. Our party is of an urgent necessity and historical inevitability .. For the workers are the architects of progress and civilization, they are the honorable hands which, with their blood and sweat, produce, provide, and protect. Throughout its history, the Egyptian working class did not find any fortress within which to find refuge, nor a shield to ward off the enemies’ arrows, nor a sworn with which to fight their enemies. So it was inevitable that it find such a fortress, sword, and shield in a party that defends it and fights for it.,,Declaration of the Democratic Workers Party’s Principles,,1 – The Workers Party calls for respecting the religious faith of every Egyptian and against discrimination between them based on religion, color, or sex. It seeks to build a civil state, built on the principles of citizenship and full equality of all Egyptian citizens and against discrimination and sectarianism.,2 – The Workers Party embraces everybody who works for a wage, workers, employees, and professionals.,3 – The Workers Party will struggle for the three principles of the Egyptian revolution: freedom, social justice, and a civil state.,4 – The Workers Party embraces in its ranks all students, intellectuals, literati, writers, artists, and every person who defends the interests of the hardworking and all of society’s oppressed.,5 – The Workers Party is open to the unemployed. It regards the issue of unemployment and the establishment of a general union of the unemployed and an unemployment allowance as priorities of the party.,6 – The Workers Party is open to all pensioners. The issues of a just pension and the distribution of looted welfare money are priorities of the party’s work.,7 – The Workers Party defends in its program the issues of poor farmers and all those oppressed in the cities and on the countryside.,8 – The Workers Party will struggle continually for the better labor relations and conditions in such a way at to make labor a main domain of achievement and innovation, instead of being a domain of misery and tragedy. Labor laws are not merely an economic relationship between worker and owner, but they directly influence the social relationships of society and family .. Just wages, a seven-hours day, and the guaranteed right to work are all important and necessary, having been withheld from Egyptian workers for many years.,9 – The Workers Party is hostile to colonialism and Zionism. The party aims at struggling together with Egypt’s masses to cancel the obsequious Camp David Accords, which leave the Sinai threatened by Zionist occupation at any time and diminishes Egyptian sovereignty in the Sinai, and squanders the blood of Egypt’s martyrs and their bitter struggle against predatory Zionism.,10 – The Workers Party calls for a complete Arab revolution against all Arab dictatorships and calls for Arab unity on the condition that it will be based on democracy and true popular will.,11 – The Workers Party believes that the Egyptian revolution’s influence will not be limited to the Arab region, but will spread to many countries. From here, we consider ourselves part of the world revolution, influenced by it and influencing it. We proclaim our solidarity with all workers and peoples of the world for a better world, ruled by justice, freedom, and equality .. a world without war and poverty.,12 – The Workers Party supports women’s issues and refuses all views that insult the status of women and look down on them .. Because women have a special place in our party and in society .. they are the light of life and make up half of our Egyptian revolution.,13 – The Workers Party strives to contribute to building an independent general union for the Egyptian working class and to preserve the union’s independence, far from any party control.,14 – The Workers Party strives to contribute to building farmers’ associations and unions in the Egyptian countryside, paving the way for an independent Egyptian farmers’ union.,15 – The Workers Party will support the struggle of the Egyptian Nubian people to recover all of their rights and to end the real persecution against them, and against the internationalization of the Nubians issue. Under the auspices of the 25 January revolution, we reclaim all rights through our struggle, trust, and confidence in the Egyptian Nubian masses.,16 – The Workers Party supports our people’s struggle in precious Sinai to own the land and to undertake real development for Sinai’s society, returning a life of dignity to their children. The Sinai is Egypt’s eastern gate and was, for ages, always the point of first confrontation for the colonizing and imperialist armies, from Hyksos to the Zionists.,17 – The Workers Party supports the struggle of poor Egyptian fishermen against the leviathans of capital controlling their lakes and against these leviathans’ destruction of the abundance of fish. The party struggles with the fishermen to set up independent associations for each fishing region and an independent general Egyptian fishermen’s union.,18 – The Workers Party will struggle for the right to social security under just conditions and to expand the range of social and health insurance for all citizens, from birth until death, against handicaps and disabilities, disease, retirement, accidents, natural and environmental disasters, unemployment, arbitrary firing, bankruptcy, orphanhood, poverty, hunger, and homelessness, in addition to full social security covering the attendant needs of motherhood, childhood, and old age.,19 – The Workers Party struggles for free education at all stages, with an interest in developing education, technology, and scientific research at the highest level world-wide and linking them to production and development plans in society.,20 – The Workers Party struggles for education, health, and housing to become basic rights for Egyptian citizens, instead of goods you sell and buy, for these humanistic rights to become like water and air, as the early pioneers’ wanted.,21 – The Workers Party regards the essence of social justice exemplified in:,- Fair distribution of wealth based on the principle of each according to his work, with complete protection for the elderly and children.,- Redesigning production in society with the goal of satisfying human needs with regard to food, clothing, housing, health, and education, rather than production for the sake of profit and accumulating wealth in the interests of a small handful of capitalists.,22 – The Workers Party aims to develop and consolidate the positive aspects of the Egyptian personality which became evident during the revolution, especially among Egypt’s revolutionary young men and women, like:,- National affiliation and collective solidarity instead of egoism and individualistic dissolution.,- Working collectively for a clean and beautiful environment.,- Free and proud people with dignity against humiliation, subservience, and submission.,23 – The Workers Party draws inspiration from the experience of popular committees which appeared spontaneously during the revolution and which protected public and private property. The party will strive to develop this popular creativity since true democracy arises from: popular committees in neighborhoods, workers’ councils in factories and industrial zones, and popular farmers’ councils in villages.,,Introduction to the Draft Program of the Democratic Workers Party,,Greetings to Egypt’s revolutionaries, to its workers and employees .. to its students and youth .. together, through our glorious revolution, we made it possible to overthrow the dictator Mubarak and imposed the dissolution of the fraudulent People’s Assembly and the Shura Council .. launching trials and calling to account the corrupt big businessmen who pilfered the people’s wealth .. But we are still at the beginning of the revolution .. our popular revolution will not calm down until the country is purged of all of the symbols of the former regime, until all those responsible are tried and the country is finally liberated from robbery, tyranny, and the impoverishment of the people for the well-being of a small handful of criminal businessmen.,We want to overthrow the regime of looting under the name of capitalism .. we want to achieve social justice .. we want to build a society of equality between people .. between Copts and Muslims .. between men and women.,Poverty, oppression, and violence didn’t differentiate between Muslims and Christians or between men and women when workers were displaced, when they were drowned on the ferry1 and incinerated in trains2 and tortured in prisons .. our social revolution will not differentiate except between oppressors and oppressed, between subjugators and the subjugated.,We want to realize the demands of the workers, the employees, the unemployed, and the poor farmers because they are the majority of the people .. during Mubarak’s long rule they suffered impoverishment, displacement, and humiliation while the businessmen accumulated billions by the blood and sweat of the poor.,All this happened by way of a strong alliance between the corrupt regime and its businessmen on the one hand and colonialism and Zionism on the other .. the regime played the role of servile agent for these forces and helped them to realize their interests in Palestine, Iraq, and Lebanon.,But the time has come for the Egyptian people to raise their heads high, to declare independence from the Americans and the Zionists and to stand beside the peoples who struggle for freedom and independence, first among them the Palestinian people who have been besieged and oppressed.,Truly the downfall of the regime does not only mean toppling its head. Rather, we want a essential change of the regime’s policies.,We do not want the businessmen and the elite to steal or halt our revolution halfway .. we want to build a part for the Egyptian workers, for all those working for a wage, and all allies of the Egyptian working class.,,Draft Program of the Democratic Workers Party,The Workers’ Struggle for Freedom,,First: Putting in place a new constitution for the country through a founding assembly elected by the people:,,Second: Completing the realization of the revolution’s democratic demands which have not yet been met, first among them:,1 – Immediately lifting the state of emergency and releasing all those detained and convicted before military or exceptional courts for matters of conscience.,2 – Prosecuting Mubarak’s family and all thieving elements of the old regime and recovering the millions looted from the Egyptian people’s wealth.,3 – Prosecuting all those responsible for crimes of torture over the last thirty years and all those responsible for assassinating the revolution’s martyrs.,4 – Prosecuting all perpetrators of sectarian crimes, first among them the criminal bombing of the Church of the Two Saints.,5 – Dissolving the State Security Investigations Service, the ruling party of the former regime, and all local councils on the level of neighborhoods, cities, and governorates ..

"The Revolution First… A Serious Purification, a Serious Trial, a Serious Government",2011-07-29,2011,"The Revolution First …. a Serious Purification, a Serious Trial, a Serious Government,,Historic moments that the country has witnessed since the outbreak of the glorious revolution of January 25th, during which honorable individuals among the children of the people came together to demand their legitimate rights, which had been robbed from them over the previous decades, and the blood of the noble martyrs flowed as they sacrificed with their pure souls to make sure these demands were met. The demands of the revolution have not changed since its first day, and were not only to overthrow the previous regime, but also to build a state whose children enjoy freedom, dignity, the rule of law, and social justice.,,Yet most of these legitimate demands were not met as a result of delays in justice, the absence of security, and blundering decisions related to the political and economic future of the country. The matter even extended to include the characterization of demonstrators, victims of the revolution, and the families of martyrs as thugs (baltagiyya). We were and still are demanding that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the current administration of the country, undertake to meet these demands immediately, without lag or delay, so that every Egyptian feels that something of the desired change has indeed come to pass.,,The revolution is not over yet, and it may oblige honorable people to come together once again, to set aside their differences and divisions, in order to safeguard the revolution and complete it until all its demands met. To do so, the Egyptian masses will descend into the streets throughout the republic on the propitious day of Friday in 2011 in a peaceful demonstration of millions, under a single banner with the slogan “The Revolution First,” demanding with one voice the realization of those of their legitimate demands that have been delayed, at all levels:,,Social Justice:,,1.

Editorial of the Publication,,,When I was contacted with an invitation from the organizers of the First Egypt Conference, which was called for by the National Advisor Dr. Mamduh Hamza, I thought about sending a message to the elite gathered in this conference, because they are a national elite, and it would be difficult for them to be present in one place again in such numbers and in such a massive gathering, and especially given that they are from the full spectrum, from all currents and beliefs and ideologies. The message that I would like to send is: “Where are the Egyptian people in what is happening?” For despite my great appreciation of the importance of this conference, its timing, and the ideas and themes raised throughout its course, it will be merely words if we do not take the Egyptian people into consideration. All the themes that will be discussed at the conference will ultimately be subjected to the opinion of the people, whether in the coming constitutional referendum, which is the first theme of the conference, or the parliamentary and presidential elections, which are the third and fourth themes of the conference, and which will reflect the opinion, firstly and ultimately, of this people. In the logic of manufacturers, the raw material currently found in the people is not fit to produce “an undistorted parliamentary council and a president of the republic who satisfies our ambitions” during the coming period—and the sense, in which the political future of Egypt will be shaped over the course of a long period, during which we will reap the fruits of our actions.,,The Egyptian people, since the 1952 revolution, have been exposed to deception and deceit at the hands of an authoritarian rule that continued until the blessed revolution of January 25th. Likewise, the media machine was a joke serving the advantage of the rulers, and thus everything that happened inside their country was hidden from this people, and most of them continue to subscribe to the same ideas that were spoon-fed to them. The evidence of this is their crying after the tyrant Hosni Mubarak’s speech, when he said “I want to die on Egyptian soil.” Is there naïveté and geniality greater than this?!,,Our goal now must be to make the Egyptian public aware of what it has and what it must do. We must broadcast to the public that we are the sons of one homeland and one nation, not work to sow discord and ill-will among the spectrum of the Egyptian people, for this is what leads us toward backwardness and stagnation. And among us the scene in Iraq must be clear: how the differences between groups within the nation, there in Iraq, has caused some to shed tears over the days of the authoritarian tyrant Saddam Hussein, when they had greater stability and security. The Egyptian people now live in a state of chaos as a result of the state of indifference in which they were living in the previous period, so it is necessary to focus on both awareness and behavior. The issue calls for all Egyptians to take a moment and look at their situation a little bit, to see what they themselves are doing.,,We must set aside ideological and religious differences. There must be one goal: how to lift Egypt up? And how will Egypt be more beautiful than the era of tyranny? All this in order to affirm to the corrupt and the authoritarian that this nation, without them, will be better than they were in it. And the spirit of Tahrir, which united around one singular goal—toppling the corrupt regime—must return. The spirit of Tahrir is what united Muslim and Christian, liberal and Muslim Brother, secularist and Salafist, Nasserist and communist, man and woman, old and young in one melting pot, in a historical scene that Egypt and the rest of the world have not forgotten and will not forget.,,We must convince the Egyptian people from across the spectrum that stability, with all its supporting forces, lies in putting in place a new constitution, for they have voted “yes” for the sake of stability, and where is stability now?!,,We must set aside our narrow differences and not seek to deepen the gap, the chasm, between us by stopping at the boundaries of ideological and religious differences, so that disunity does not become the cause of the collapse of a nation that we all strive to build. We must be loyal to the blood of the martyrs of January 25th.,,We must spread security, tolerance, affection, love, and the right of our people to belong to different sects, agreeing to respect the freedoms of thought, belief, and expression. The responsibility of building political consciousness among this nation’s children remains on the shoulders of the elite from across the spectrum and of all persuasions. We need to build a constructive political consciousness among the Egyptian people, one that contributes to the progress and improvement of this great nation, and we must do so during the coming period. We must emerge from this conference into the city squares, towns, villages, and streets to address society’s individuals, forgetting our houses, our children, and our spouses, devoting ourselves only to this duty in the coming period. And if there is any failure from the elite, intellectuals, and political parties (old and new), you will have nobody to blame but yourselves because you left the people prey to ideologies, and those with interests and loudspeakers were able to influence them and exploited them to the utmost in order to realize their misguided and deceitful ambitions.,,2. Why Do They Want Us to Regret the Revolution?,It is terribly regrettable that the current counterrevolutionary powers were part of the powers that participated in the revolution. Then they exploited it, abandoned it, and subordinated it to serve their own interests… hoping to realize a long-awaited dream of ruling Egypt… and none of the current authorities want to accept this reality, recognizing it and admitting that they know it well… What is the meaning of the absence of security, and the spread of thuggery (al-baltaga) at all levels, the state of chaos, the increase in unemployment, price inflation, increased cost of living, increased sectarianism as the Salafists and extremists emerge onto the scene. It is as though Egypt were epitomized in these fanatical fundamentalist groups and the erroneous choices made for sensitive positions—for example the governors and some of the ministers in the current government, and the retention of police officers accused of killing demonstrators in their positions up to now—and the disappearance of the features of the future, and the clearly unjustified ambiguities in many of the military council’s decisions… I, Egypt, should not regret the Mubarak regime, but it seems that there are those who urge and pressure us to announce our regret.,,,An Appeal to the Honorable,of the Political Elite, Intellectuals, Writers, and Youth of the Revolution,,3. The Political Map and the Future of Egypt,The battle over the last referendum proved that the Egyptian people still require some time in order to know what they want and not be affected by any trend that could influence them to the degree that the result of the referendum made clear. For despite the fact that most of the political powers that participated in making the revolution of January 25th, and likewise all the candidates now on the scene for the presidency of the republic, supported voting “no,” religious affiliation, social class, educational level, and finally political affiliation still played an important role in this result. The question here is: will this be the political map of Egypt after the revolution of January 25th, a map expected to form an important aspect of political life during the coming period? The response here is “no,” for not all the “yes” voters belong to the Islamic stream, nor likewise are all the “no” voters from the new political and social powers. For this map is not fixed, but is rather in a state of constant fluidity, with the possibility of change and renewal continually arriving. For example, someone who voted for and sympathized with the Brotherhood under the previous regime will not do so in the future… But there is something dangerous there, which is that those who talk about the impossibility of applying democracy in Egypt rely on the Egyptians’ lack of true political education, just as there is a great imbalance represented in the presence of approximately 50% of the population on the spectrum between being politically illiterate and educationally illiterate, and this majority holds the power to drive and direct Egypt in the coming period, whether from a media standpoint, religious means or electoral bribes, for it alone possesses the gains of the democratic game, which has flaws commensurate to its many advantages. Therefore, if the political elite, writers, honorable intellectuals, and media machinery neglect the recommendation to develop the political consciousness of all segments of the Egyptian population, and especially the illiterate among them, they will leave a great vacuum to the religious and fundamentalist movements, who will guide this neutral bloc in whatever direction they like. We are approaching parliamentary and presidential elections in a very short period of time, and fraud is not just a matter of ballot-stuffing, the dead and the missing casting votes, and the like, as in the previous regime. Rather, fraud’s ugliest image now is the use of certain ideologies, straw men, and false, deceptive rumors to steer a major voting bloc to support particular orientations, to our great regret. As for now, it is necessary to employ the positive energy of Egyptians after the “January 25th” revolution in organizational vessels like political parties, unions, and labor, because these constitute defenses that safeguard and care for this revolution, increasing the awareness of the people and allowing them to know what they want. They also eliminate the arrogance with which some of the political powers were stricken, feeling that they owned the street, which was not true. All segments of the Egyptian people must know that America and Israel are not interested in the orientation of who will govern Egypt, whether Islamist or fundamentalist. What America fears most is that Egypt will make its decision independently.,,,4. When Will al-Azhar Return to Being a Beacon for Egypt and the Islamic World?,In the absence of the role of al-Azhar, extremist movements filled the vacuum that al-Azhar left on the scene. It is necessary for al-Azhar to return to its previous status, after the Egyptian public lost confidence in it as an official institution because the previous regime held the power to conduct its affairs. It has now become necessary for intellectual and financial independence to be achieved for al-Azhar, far from the government, and for it to hold a clear influence to conduct the religious affairs of Muslims. It must return to fill the vacuum that it left to others who distorted the Egyptians’ religious discourse, as an institution of centrist Islam of which Egypt can be proud, far from the extremism of some currents, and as an influential religious university before being a secular university. Al-Azhar was the beacon that contributed to making Egypt’s history, ancient and modern, for it was the foremost institution of higher learning in the Islamic world since the Fatimid era. If we look at al-Azhar and its role at the beginning of the modern age, we find that its shaykhs had a historic role, as in the al-Azhar shaykhs’ defense of Egypt against the French campaign, the appointment of Muhammad ‘Ali to rule Egypt, and the removal of the Ottoman sultan. And from al-Azhar emerged the great scholars who made the modern history of Egypt, like Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abduh, ‘Abd al-’Aziz Gawish, Muhammad Mustafa al-Maraghi, and al-Ahmadi al-Dhawahiri. And from al-Azhar emerged also the revolutionary scholars who called for a modern order and a civil, civilized state, like Shaykh ‘Ali ‘Abd al-Raziq in his book Islam and the Ages of Government and the major author Khalid Muhammad Khalid in his book From Here We Begin. Al-Azhar was the institution that maintained the Islamic faith in Egypt and provided it with a centrist vision.,,When al-Azhar became a university teaching modern worldly sciences alongside religious ones, it lost its original character as a university for religious sciences from a centrist perspective and retreated from its historic role. Trust in it was lost because of its lack of financial and intellectual independence and its subordination to the regime. This retreat led to the development of Salafist and religious extremist movements, most of whose adherents did not truly study religious sciences at al-Azhar. A movement of new preachers emerged on the satellite channels to pull confidence out from under the feet of the al-Azhar scholars. The time has come for al-Azhar to return as an institution for religious sciences only, to mold for us shaykhs and great scholars as it did in the past; to put forward an enlightened religious discourse for Egyptians and Muslims throughout the world in order to keep pace with the developments that are now taking place in Egypt and the Arab and Islamic world; and to be a destination (qibla) for all Muslim youths in all corners of the Earth, that they might return to their homelands after learning the religious sciences and the language to spread them in their countries.,There is no doubt that this will not happen without financial independence, through the existence of Islamic endowments (awqaf) to pay the scholars of al-Azhar far from the role of the state.,,5. We Want It to Be a Civil State, Not a Religious One,No sooner had the Egyptian people enjoyed their glorious revolution than it was overtaken by the shock of the people’s division into different groups—religious, secular, liberal, and otherwise—and we came to be living in a quasi-war that turned us, to our great dismay, into foes. Those who undertook the revolution and sacrificed their pure blood were not expecting this sudden transformation in the revolution, for all previous divisions had only contributed to the success of this revolution and were not limited to only one group without the inclusion of another. Therefore, the enemies of the revolution began to foment discord and intrigue in order to fragment all the political powers that contributed to the revolution and steal from us the joyful pleasure and ecstasy of victory for even a single moment.,,You must, dear citizen, read, think, and contemplate, and after that it is your right to choose what you want. We say to you: trust in God, and before you give your trust, you must understand that in which you put your trust.,,Dear citizen, you must know that there is a difference between an Islamic state and a religious state, for an Islamic state is a civil state that observes the just, revealed law of God in the universe and the communities. It is based upon the protection of truth and goodness, the development of production, restriction of consumption, and justice of distribution. It is also based on freedom (not enslavement), consultation (not tyranny), on the people (not the individual), internationalization (not survival), and accountability for all negligence and corruption. A civil state provides a dignified life for all its citizens; Egypt includes Muslims, Christians, and a few followers of other religions in its demographic composition, and these are all required to perform their duties in building and safeguarding the nation, which it would not be possible to do sincerely and with dedication unless one feels he is a citizen with full rights. Our revolution was undertaken so that we might reclaim freedoms and ensure equality, and citizenship is the only way to realize these principles, to translate the dreams of the revolution. This must be the only reference for a civil state. The ballot box does not differentiate between Muslim and Christian, and the state of the prophet of God—may God honor him and grant him peace—was a civil state recognizing the right of dhimmis1 and granting them the right of citizenship (and we find Imam Muhammad ‘Abduh) says “Islam tore down the building of religious authority and did not entrust to anybody after the prophet of God—may God honor him and grant him peace—authority over anyone’s doctrine, nor control over his faith. The prophet of God—may God honor him and grant him peace—was a messenger, not a dominator and not a controller, for the Most High said: “So remind [O Muhammad]; you are only a reminder (21) You are not over them a controller (22)” (Surat al-Ghashiyya [The Overwhelming], 21, 22).,Meanwhile, a religious state is based on the notion that the ruler is the caliph of God on Earth and that divine laws are the laws that must be applied. They are implemented by clerics who have an intimate knowledge of these divine laws and in whom God’s authority is represented. This is what obliges the people to obey all orders and instructions that the clerics issue, given that they are of divine provenance. And it is no secret to anyone that politicians in a religious state could employ religion to torture and oppress scholars and intellectuals who contravene their point of view. Many situations in the history of Arab and Islamic civilization bear witness to this fact, and to emphasize this, historical experience tells us that the scope of freedom expands more in a civil state, for religious rule tempts the majority to persecute the minority, and leaders are tempted to exploit the holiness of religion to justify their behavior and cover up their mistakes. Religious judgments are absolute judgments, but as for political judgments, they are relative judgments because they are manmade, and it is not possible to judge the absolute by what is relative. Humans, in their practice of politics, make mistakes and cause injury. Evaluating humans’ practice of politics from a religious perspective restricts matters to the logic of unbelief and belief. The linking of religion and politics is detrimental to both religion and politics, for the supporters of a religious state accuse democracy of being based on human inclinations, and humans by their nature are fickle and vulnerable to error, while religious rule bases its legislation on a source that is above humans with their error and manifest weakness, but in this same attribute lie the virtues of democracy and the greatness of the civil state.,,,6. Is It Possible For the Turkish Example to Succeed in Egypt?!,Talk of the Turkish example have become of paramount importance in the circumstances through which Egypt is passing, especially after the revolution of January 25th and the new spirit that resulted from it, allowing for the total integration of different political parties in addition to an advanced understanding of the relationship between religion as the supply-house of civilization, and politics, in their own respect, as a different mode of thinking and an attempt to move matters forward… We face a difficult equation that calls for an expansive field of vision, far-sightedness, and an ability to absorb the Turkish experience while acknowledging the existing differences between Egypt and Turkey. The matter calls for an objective understanding of the relationship between Islam and politics, and this after a fracture happened between the religious currents, the civil currents, and those who believe that the matter calls for a great deal of courage, faith in citizenship, and looking toward a parliamentary system, which helps to understand the Turkish experience in recent years. The political powers in Egypt, including the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, must be called upon in the necessity of reading the Turkish experience, for we do not reject the notion that the philosophical source of a modern party be Islam on the condition that their activities are purely political and do not confuse matters or cause other religions anxiety.,,7. So As Not To Make a Tyrant Again,The history of tyranny in Egypt is a long one, equivalent to ancient Egyptian history on the banks of the Nile. We Egyptians once deified rulers and made dictators on this earth, based on the logic that the Egyptian state throughout its history is a centralized state governed by the ruler and his retinue with the support of the military. We Egyptians were brought up on the notion that everything in the system of government exists in a pyramidal structure, at the top of which sits the ruler and after him the retinue according to their level. Then there is the military protecting them, and at the base are the people, whom the tyrannical ruler looks upon, despite their being the general public, as mere tools which he exploits for his selfish interests, ordering them to obey without recognizing any rights for these subjects.,,In our educational curricula, justifications for tyranny were disseminated according to which the ruler was made of a substance other than that of which mere mortals were made, and was able to do everything. Media institutions contributed to the creation of the dictator by following his news and publishing his pictures in all the press, even if this news was mere routine. It was as though all the state institutions were exploited only for his sake, so that we saw nobody but him. The ruler’s retinue contributed constantly by creating a barrier between him and the people, and the security institutions were able to repress the people and sow fear among them—fear of the ruler’s ability to brutalize in any place, at any time. The security apparatus was used to safeguard the ruler and his retinue, not for the security of the people and their institutions. We discovered that our tyrant ruler spent our nourishment and money on this apparatus, to provide himself with tools of torture and harassment. The number of police assigned to protecting internal security became larger than the members of the army that protects the nation’s borders from enemies.,,We need a new culture to be broadcast in our media, educational systems, and political practice, one based on the culture of equality between the children of the same nation regardless of any class, religious, or political differences. We want a new culture in which the people know their rights and obligations, and all are equal before the law, with no difference between ruler and ruled, which must be applied to all without exception.,,Egypt must be a state of law; the law must not be a whip or a truncheon in the hands of the powerful by which they rule the weak. We want to spread, through education and the media, a culture of freedom among the Egyptian people that shatters the long history of fear that tyrannical regimes made in the Egyptians’ souls. We must move from a culture of slavery, humiliation, and servility to a culture of freedom, democracy, and equality.,,Truly, abandoning the culture of slavery and resignation for the culture of freedom is the only path by which we can thwart any kind of manifestation of tyranny in any of the state’s institutions, thereby making progress and prosperity in human life.,",Constitution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130154354im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/untitled.png,imgID235,

In fact, the party has actually started to execute its program in numerous fields to realize its goals in the service of the country and its citizens by putting pressure on the current government and the Military Council. For example, since its establishment in 2007, the party has called in its agenda for the necessity of cancelling the state security investigation apparatus, and this is what in fact occurred.,,The party’s symbol:,The party’s symbol (77) is an expression of the percentage of the silent majority of citizens, the percentage of those able to vote, but who chose not to have their voices heard in general elections because of their conviction that their votes had no value in rigged elections.

Did You Know?,2011-07-28,2011,"Did you know?,,1 – Did you know that the highest-flying flag in the Egyptian sky is the flag on the Israeli embassy?,2 – Did you know that the occupation of Egypt really withdrew on the 11th of February, 2011?,3 – Did you know that Hitler, the Nazi, is better than the ousted Mubarak? The first killed the Jews for the sake of his people; the second killed his people for the sake of the Jews. The proof: his millions of dollars of support for Israel every day while the people of Egypt ate from the garbage.,4 – Did you know that the area of land stolen from Egypt is 68 kilometers squared – an area bigger than five Arab countries: Palestine, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain?,5- Did you know that the police and the thugs are one and the same? The proof: a group of thugs caused a disturbance at the Imbaba Church, and the police left them alone while they increased their number and people started killing each other. Also, dozens of thugs attacked protestors at Maspero with any action from anyone. However, when tens of thousands of people gathered peacefully in front of the Israeli Embassy to clear their minds of the memory of the Nakba, the police immediately started making arrests and hitting people and disperesed the crowd. Is the Israeli Embassy more precious and more revered than Egypt’s stability?,6 – Did you know that the graft and the fallen regime are one and the same? The proof: the clear delay in bringing regime loyalists to trial; and then Suzanne Mubarak’s feigning illness when her imprisonment was announced, followed by her instant recovery when she and Mubarak were released. Then there was the fragile heart and the cancer that appeared in his body by the will of God. Where are his words threatening us when he is between chaos or stability? The whole thing is a comic play.,7- Did you know that Murtada Mansur and Tal’at al-Sadat are two-faced liars? The former lost his constituency because he had insulted the supporters of al-Ahly, after they promised him he would be tossed out, and kept their promise. Everything he did was nothing but a media show. The second stood in Tahrir Square on 1 February and said calls for Mubarak and the National Democratic Party to step down were in vain. When he was appointed president of the party said it was his inheritance from his uncle. He also said no one should be disrespectful to the symbol (Mubarak) because he is a real patriot and someone who can truly change the conditions in the country. It appears the opportunists will get what they want at the expense of their principles. Tala’at is an inextricable part of this. For this, we say to the remnants of the fallen regime, the remnants of our country’s security apparatus, and to anyone who wants to pretend under any banner or calculations that we will toss aside the gains of our successful, popular, peaceful revolution, we say to them, with God’s permission, by raising our voices and singing “Revolutionaries, revolutionaries”.,,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries are in the line of fire,,Children, girls, old men,,Women and boys are larger than life,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries, day and night,,Until we see you free forever, oh Egypt,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries,Against those who shamed you, those who betrayed you,Those who sold you and destroyed our home,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries, against those who oppressed us,Those who stole from us and acted as if they were heroes,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries, against all the villains, all those like Iblis,Who brought to Egypt, our country, disgrace,Revolutionaries, O Egypt, there is goodness in you that went to the other,And from you billions were pocketed,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries, against corruption, against the regime,Against every dictator in the country,Revolutionaries, revolutionaries, until we try every thief who stole from the people, even so little as a dollar.,,The poet: Sayyid Sharaf,Thursday, March 26, 2011,[e-mail redacted],and Facebook,","Culture, Poetry",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153602im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/didyouknow.png,imgID238,

Revolution Until Victory,2011-07-26,2011,"Revolution Until Victory,Six months to remove Mubarak and the figureheads of his regime, yet the corrupt regime still suffocates us with its clear social and economic favoritism and its hostility towards the poor classes of people who were the fuel of the revolution. This regime serves the interests of its own social class which sucked the blood of our people before the 25 January Revolution. It played a significant role in the administration of the counter-revolution in order to preserve its economic interests, which are in direct conflict with the interests of the great majority of our people.,The same policies of Mubarak’s regime still continue in all sectors: in education, in healthcare, in support of exporters with four billion dollars yearly, in support of the five-star hotels with gas that the Egyptians cannot find while the government continues in its support of the Israelis with it. The Egyptian regime still supports the factories of the capitalists, who suck our blood and whose luxury cars waste our energy while at the same time a poor Egyptian national can’t find his daily bread. The Egyptian media still falsifies the facts. The Egyptian Interior Ministry still insists on dealing with us as though it were an army, viewing the Egyptian people as an enemy. The Egyptian government still insists on purchasing rubber bullets, live ammunition, and gas bombs with the Egyptian people’s money for the thugs of the Interior Ministry to kill the Egyptian people.,We have before us a scheme, a systematic effort to break-up the unity of the revolutionaries. We now face the apostates of the revolution, represented in the retreat away from the achievement the revolution’s goals by those who assumed command of the country. Whether the Military Council or the government, they call themselves the ‘Government of the Revolution.’ We are also facing negligence in regard to the spilling of the revolutionary martyrs’ blood and the release of the killers and the corrupt. We are confronted with an ousted dictator living in prosperity at a time when civilians are handed over to military courts. Faced with all of this, we find no alternative but to return to the square again. No one will carry our revolution except us, and no one will return the rights of Egypt’s poor other than themselves.,We are in the Union of Socialist Youth. Since we are well aware that the Military Council has not been capable of running the country, we demand the transference of power to the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court during the transitional period with the assurance that our revolution will continue until the complete achievement of its objectives, primarily social justice. This cannot be done without the existence of a regime that truly reflects the will of the poor, returning the lands that were pillaged from them—whether though the ownership and tenant law or through the corrupt transfer of land from the Egyptian people to a handful of corrupt individuals, a regime that returns the ownership of all the privatized companies and factories back to their workers.,Since we affirm our adherence to the slogan “the Constitution first,” we also affirm that the implementation of this goal will not come without the continuation of the revolution and that it will not be achieved if it is first separated from the slogan “the poor first.” We will not agree to a Constitution that is drawn up by the same social class that causes our woes and infects our people with cancer. The Constitution must express the interests of the poor and guarantee the defense of these interests. The poor must participate in drafting it.

The Wafd: Truth above Power and the Nation above Government,2011-07-24,2011,"The Wafd Truth Above Power and the Nation Above Government,,The Revolution Will Not Retreat,,In these critical moments of the history of our great nation, free, struggling, we pay tribute to the righteous martyrs of Egypt who paid dearly with their lives to guarantee our freedom which the previous regime regarded as nonexistent through 30 years of poverty and oppression and subjugation and tyranny. We commit ourselves by their pure souls to continuing to demand the realization of the revolution’s slogan—Freedom, Bread, Justice—which still stumbles at the feet of those hoping to achieve political and authoritarian benefits and take the nation backwards at the expense of the revolution’s progress and success. We are sure that building a just democratic Egypt cannot be completed before demolishing all the corrupt laws made by the dictatorial and totalitarian regime. Therefore we demand the lifting of legislation that includes corrupt texts and the immediate beginning of restructuring the legislative foundation in a way that does not entrench tyranny and does not contribute in making a new dictator. Because the next ruler will never permit canceling the advantages that previous presidents obtained. He will not permit the taking of his powers that enable him to practice tyranny after his ascendance to the throne of Egypt. This threatens the path of the revolution which was undertaken for the sake of a free civil state … the revolution which will never allow—ever—a return to the era of making tyrannical pharaohs.,,Therefore we demand,1. Redividing electoral districts to correspond to the number of residents in each district.,2. Undertaking the coming parliamentary elections by a system of completely proportional lists in order to allow the opportunity for all political powers to participate and giving voters the opportunity to differentiate between the programs and excluding the control of capital.,3. Reconsidering the way that local council elections will be carried out and canceling the current system which leads to granting the authorities the opportunity to control these councils which reflect, in reality, the interests of the ruler and the corrupt mafia.,4. Issuing a special new law for unions permitting the establishment of independent labor and trade unions, according to which the interests of their members are realized and consistent with the nature of the labor law which protects workers’ rights and is far from the old union structures deriving from the totalitarian and communist regimes that collapsed by their own hands.,The revolution was undertaken to establish concepts that protect the dignity and freedom and right of the citizen in the nation’s administration. Therefore we look forward to putting in place fundamental rules for a just, civil, democratic Egypt through a new law allowing localities to practice direct democracy in the manner appropriate with the population density in each district. Likewise, we demand that new laws be put in place allowing the establishment of free independent unions and we look forward to agreement on a constitution delineating the rights and duties of the ruler and the ruled and protecting Egypt’s civil government and its tolerance and its freedom for which Egyptians paid dearly over the long decades, beginning with the `Urabi revolt and continuing through the 1919 revolution and culminating with the January 25 revolution.,,Long live the struggle of the revolution and long live free Egypt,—The Wafd Party,Friday 8/7/2011,","Politics, Wafd Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151436im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/scaled.%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-0.png,imgID246,

It is also necessary to strengthen the country by publicly continuing, on the radio and in the media, the trials of those that killed protesters, without postponing their court sessions, as those criminals once did to their opponents.

"Gurnal, Volume #1",2011-07-22,2011,"Gurnal, Volume 1,[page 1],The Legitimate Demands of the 25th of January Revolution,,And we as a group suggest the addition of another demand to the official demands of the Revolution: the dissolution of the National Democratic Party.,,Our Say:,We are a group of young people contemporary with the change that has happened for ourselves and others in and outside of Tahrir Square during the events of this revolution. We’ve undertaken different tasks: cleaning, directing traffic, guarding shops, securing the streets, etc.,One of the principle reasons for working on this newspaper is to spread awareness among the people and ensure that this revolution is not commandeered by different currents or parties; we see that this is a popular revolution and must stay that way.,Also, the revolution has not yet finished, so we must stand firm and complete the tasks that were begun by a group of youths. There are still political prisoners in detainment, the national security apparatus is still in place and functioning, and there are still elements of the corrupt regime that have not yet been dealt with, as the National Democratic Party has not been dissolved.,But to prevent any elements or currents from commandeering the revolution, we ask that the spirit of national unity continue among all social classes, and that we think not as factions but as Egyptians.,We believe in total freedom of expression, and in this newspaper we will welcome any opinions, for we have pledged not to impose any opinions, and also to welcome any articles, poetry or drawings regardless of our agreement with or opposition to the opinions presented therein, as our goal is the total freedom of expression that has been forbidden to us for more than 30 years.,,[page 2],– Interview with the Consultant Hisham al-Bastawisi, p. 3,,– Did the Regime Fall? p.7,,– Mu’ammar “I give speeches in an empty square” al-Qaddafi, p. 10,,– We See You… p. 6,,– The Wounded of the Revolution, pp. 13-15,,[page 3],,Has the regime fallen?,Of course the regime hasn’t fallen yet. President Mubarak, rather than managing the state from the presidential palace, has begun to direct it from Sharm el-Sheikh. A few of the symbols of the regime have been sacrificed to try and absorb the anger in the streets and allow the regime to remain. And the crippling [word play on ""amendment""] of the constitution, I mean, the regime is still in place even though its legitimacy has ended since the people revolted. And now we have to follow the legitimacy of the revolution, repeal the constitution completely, and put a new constitution in place. This isn’t as hard as everyone thinks, for we have more than one constitution that is in fact better than the one we desire, and voting on the constitution will not take months, as is alleged.,Changing the constitution will be considered a true completion of the revolution, because with the end of Constitution 74, this era will end, and with it all of the administrative corruption, and we will begin a new era established on a strong constitution and principles of fairness that satisfy the current demands on the Egyptian street. Therefore, those in power must recognize the legitimacy of the revolution and the nullification of the constitution. The articles that the constituent council is altering will form a temporary constitution until the election of Parliament. But if the amended Constitution 74 remains in place throughout the entire transitional period, it is possible that the people’s demands could be implemented inequitably.,,Who will supervise the next Parliamentary elections?,To ensure the greatest standard of integrity, the judiciary stipulated ensuring its actual independence before it would supervise elections. There is no reason that international monitoring should not take place to further ensure integrity throughout the upcoming elections.,,What are the main demands directed at those in power?,• The declaration that the amended constitution is a temporary constitution until such time as a Parliament is in place, when the people will then vote on a new constitution in order to protect their rights.• The punishment of all those who are corrupt and responsible for the crimes that were committed is the right of the protestors.• The release of all political prisoners.• The specification of the role of state security as the combatting of terrorism (with a clarification of what terrorism is, and so as not to lead to the deterioration of political life).• Dissolving Shafiq’s government and designating a temporary government whose members are known for their independence.,,In your opinion, what is the army’s position regarding popular demands?,In my opinion, from within, the army wants to fulfill popular demands, but some of those who have influence from within have a vested interest in the survival of the previous regime, which is slowing the implementation of these demands.,And because of this, the army must be pressured via sit-ins and a very clear demonstration of these basic demands until they are implemented quickly. No force, internal or external, can stand in the way of the revolution, not even the army or the United States itself. This became abundantly clear when the Egyptian streets proved that they are united and forced the United States to support them in spite of the fact that the Mubarak regime was in the best interest of this country allied to Israel.,,What means of pressure exist in order to realize these demands?,Contrary to what many think, weekly sit-ins are an effective means through which to pressure the attorney general and the supreme council of the armed forces to hasten the implementation of these demands. I remind everyone that differences around upcoming constitutional changes or presidential choices or the state system are premature because the regime still has not fallen and we must unite to face this regime first, and then begin looking toward the future.,,[page 4],Cairo: Despite the fact that the committee which the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces tasked with amending the current constitution has almost finished its work, it still faces widespread criticism, both on the political level and regarding rights themselves.,Many interested specialists in the legal field and constitutional matters have criticized the idea of amendments. These condemnations are directed at a number of issues. Among these criticisms are the sufficiency of modifying 5 articles, repealing only one, and not creating a new constitution, especially since the revolution overthrew the ruling regime and the existing constitution. Also, experts with ideological political leanings have joined the committee, and there are no women on it. Additionally, the current formation does not represent the political diversity of the country, and lawmakers from the old regime are even present on the committee itself. In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the committee is made up of seven experts, headed by the consultant Tariq al-Bashari, the First Deputy to the former Chair of the Council of State. Also, there are Dr. ‘Atif al-Banna, Professor of Constitutional Law at Cairo University, Hatim Bigatu, Chief of Commissioners at the Constitutional Court and aide to the former Minister of Justice, Hassanayn ‘Abd al-‘Al, aide on legal matters to the Speaker of the People’s Assembly , the consultant Muhammad al-Shanawi, former Chief of the Court, Subhi Salih, former representative from the Muslim Brotherhood in the People’s Assembly, and Hussein Badarawi, aide to the Minister of Justice for Legislative Administration.,Following what is happening now in the constitution drafting committee from the sidelines, it is difficult for us to see through the haze and lack of clarity. [This is the case] because the committee itself is made up of members of the previous regime and their aides and has no female perspective on the issue of the constitution or rights. There are also no independent constitutional scholars from this society that do not belong to any political or non-political current, for example: Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu al-Magd, the esteemed lawyer Isam al-Islambuli, Dr. Yahya al-Gamal, Dr. Muhammad Badran, and the consultant Tahani al-Gabali. It seems like the committee’s formation resembles the political spread of the representatives from the old regime with symbolic representation from the Muslim Brotherhood while other important national movements remain absent.,When discussing the creation of a new constitution, its formulation must agree with the current situation. Social necessity in relation to technological developments such as the emergence of Facebook and modern communications by mobile phone and e-mail, etc., demands this agreement. All of these things were not found in old constitutions, resulting in the underdevelopment from which many countries, among them Egypt, suffered. Now communication through technological means has become a fait accompli. It has no substitute; it is a human right which cannot be ignored. This is in addition to creative rights, which are the harbinger of the rise of peoples and spread of their cultures. Has the committee taken this problem into account or do the rights of communication, intellectual property, and creative rights remain outside of human necessity?,The history of revolution assures us of an important fact: revolution is the knowledge of change (not of replacement or rebuilding). The change for which we are calling is a total transformation of institutions and political structures within the country in order to establish a new order conforming with the spirit of the revolution. By changing or amending some of the articles in the constitution while preserving other parts of the text, one actually maintains the goals of the former regime which contradict the goals of the revolution. This creates a barrier in fulfilling the ambitions and aspirations of the general public.,As for the committee not having any women on it, it is completely unacceptable for half of society. It casts doubt on the future of democratic change in Egypt after the revolution and brings up questions regarding future participation, whereas the revolution aimed for freedom for all of society and not just limited sections. That does not mean to say that skepticism as regards the efficiency and integrity of the committee is a problem since it is headed by Tariq al-Bashari. This man’s history as far as professionalism, morality, and thoughtful contribution make him acceptable for everyone.,As for the amendments which will be made to the constitution, they are the same amendments upon which President Mubarak agreed before he left. They consist of five articles having to do with presidential term-limits, qualifications for candidacy, judicial monitoring of elections, the repeal of the article which permitted the president to declare a state of emergency, and referring citizens to military courts. The amendments are of little value and will not possibly lead to a democratic system, especially since the 25th of January Revolution overthrew and overrode the constitution. From there, it called for the proclamation of a new constitution. The amending of the constitution does not call for a voiding of the [the current constitution]. Amendments are what would happen under normal circumstances. However, following the success of the revolution, it is now necessary to completely repeal the constitution and create a new one in line with the demands of the next stage.The biggest flaw in the constitution is that it gives the president broad authority and allows him to exercise hegemony over all other authorities. It is within his rights to dissolve parliament and head up the Supreme Councils for Judges and the Armed Forces and the police and appoint their leaders. He also appoints one-third of the Shura Council and ten members of the People’s Assembly.,The constitution does not distinguish between executive and legislative powers and affects the independence of judges. Amending the constitution is not enough. It does not fulfill the aspirations of the Egyptian people who rose in a revolution praised by the world’s leaders who even called for teaching lessons about the revolution in their schools. Therefore, it is only right to work toward a new constitution founding a democratic state.,We call for the implementing of a parliamentary constitution because that is closer to the spirit of the Egyptian people. We would then have a president with limited powers, a president of an elected government, and a strong parliament which monitors itself—along with power to hold votes of no-confidence when it makes mistakes or fails in its commitments and duties to the people.,Khalid Tal‘atAppeals and Supreme Constitutional Attorney,","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144812im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Gurnalpages1-41.png,imgID250,
National Constitution Party: The White Olive Branch Revolution,2011-07-22,2011,"The “National Constitution” Party [a party to assemble and not to divide!] announces,,The White Olive Branch Revolution (Friday, the 1st of July 2011),Aiming to restore the ’54 constitution in order to accomplish the goals of the Mother Revolution (January 25th 2011),,,–It is every Egyptian’s responsibility to be proud that we, the Egyptians, were the earliest of modern peoples in our national struggle, from resisting French occupation, through the beginning of the age of modernization, at the hands of Muhammad ‘Ali Pasha, then passing through the glorious ‘Urabi revolt and 1919 revolution.,,–After independence, we had the ’23 constitution, which was considered one of the best contemporary constitutions, and under its auspices a first-class modern state was established that stands on firm institutions of education, economy, administrative systems, and justice.,,–When the tyrant Fu’ad I in ’30 attempted to repeal the ’23 constitution and install a counterfeit constitution in order to practice his tyrany constitutionally, the people blew up in a violent revolution in order to restore the ’23 constitution. They were not subdued until the tyrant re-instated it despite himself, and in the Cairo Revolution of ’30, the Egyptian populace proved the maturity of its constitutional consciousness, and that it would not accept a constitution that did not effectuate national security and the dignity of the citizenry.,,–By the time the officers undertook their movement of ’52, the democratic constitution of ’23 had won Egypt a well-regarded position at the world level. The Egyptian Stock Exchange was sixth in the world thanks to a currency stronger than the dollar and sterling, the Egyptian University was tenth, the zoo second, and Egyptian cotton first. As for sports, the three first centers for long swimming were reserved for the Nile Crocodiles. All of this at a time when most peoples of the world did not yet know the meaning of a state, or were still on the first steps of civilization’s staircase. And yet circumstances necessitated a new constitution after the fall of the monarchy.,,–In preparation for the return of civilian life, as promised by the officers of the liberation, the general Muhammad Naguib convened a committee of fifty members. These included the shaykh of Al-Azhar and several of his scholars, six prominent figures from the Muslim Brotherhood, representatives of the church, men of the law and military, as well as secularists and communists, and the parties created a constitution including all democratic precepts. It established local government by free election, from the foundation on down to the governors, so that the people would monitor the government’s performance. It also gave the parliament regulatory powers over the powers of the ruler and ensured the protection of the national revolution, national sovereignty, national security, and citizens’ dignity.,,–And when the tyrannous officers disguised this constitution among pseudo-constitutions amenable to their tyranny — concluding with the ’71 constitution — they committed a repulsive crime against the nation, and so the Egyptian people tasted shame and oppression at the hands of tyrants such as they had never tasted before in their long history. As such, the White Olive Branch Revolution has appeared, urgently demanding the nation’s rescue from the ghost of the malicious ’71 constitution that still threatens the nation with doom.,,–When the “National Constitution” Party decided on Friday, the 1st of July, to announce this white revolution, it did so to avert two imminent catastrophes. The first is the preparations for a conference to spread secularism amongst citizens, which means a disastrous collision between secularists and Salafis. The second is the announcement by a group of youth that the seventh of July will be a final warning to realize the demands of the revolution, which means a disastrous collision between them and the military council. But all of the demands of the revolution could be met merely by restoring our national constitution, and this demand will return national accord between Salafis and secularists and between the military and civilians, as was the case amongst the council of fifty who formulated this constitution.,,–If it can restore national accord, then the White Olive Branch Revolution will be satisfied with the honor it has gained in opposing the counter-revolution organized by the remnants of the obsolete regime and its agents. So it is the responsibility of all who contribute to and advocate for this white revolution to rescue our dear Egypt from the evil of these traitors. The recompense which God has prepared is for the loyal is for their nations that worship him, and it is for God to determine the way.,,With greetings from M. ‘Ali Yusif ‘Ali, B.A. in Engineering, M.A. in Law, Diploma in translation, [phone # redacted] [e-mail redacted],","Other Parties, Politics, Theory",NA,imgID251,

Call for the first protest rally in front of the headquarters of the Central Auditing Agency,2011-07-21,2011,"Call for the first protest rally in front of the headquarters of the Central Auditing Agency,The people reject the complicity of the Central Auditing Agency in the protection of corrupt individuals.,Bring the “secret protection” files to light.,After the Illegal Earnings Agency decided to release several of the previous regime’s figureheads, including Fathi Surur, Zakariyya ‘Azmi, and Suzanne Mubarak, it is clear that system of state regulators, led by the Central Auditing Agency, is covering up the most important crimes of corruption perpetrated against the Egyptian people.,It is common knowledge amongst all honorable Egyptians and all the liberal revolutionaries that the emergence of these individuals from their cells is even more dangerous and harmful to the future of Egypt. Their release represents a constant threat to the security and stability of the country, as well as to the noble endeavor of eradicating a past that they corrupted over the course of thirty years. It also amounts to an invasive threat to the Egyptians’ dreams and aspirations for just retribution and for the recovery of the money that has been pillaged from the country. This money, which is in the millions, could rejuvenate the Egyptian economy and provide the contribution necessary for raising the average Egyptian’s quality of life.,Jawdat al-Malt, the president of the Central Auditing Agency before the revolution, had consistently followed corrupt policies in the administration of this important regulatory system. He grew accustomed to releasing corruption files that only concerned the consumers among the regime’s men, files that did not concern the heads of the regime and did not even come close to the deposed president, his family, and his close associates. Instead, he grew accustomed to releasing the kind of files that distract public opinion and absorb the Egyptians’ anger, causing it to disappear. These issues concerning the corruption of the deposed president and his family, the figureheads of his corruption,and the files on the corruption of the Interior Ministry and State Security all represent red lines that Jawdat al-Malt does not dare cross.,For example, where are the files that allocate the lands of Tushki to Walid ibn Talal at a price that is one-eighth its value, in violation of the provisions of the law, at this very moment? Where are the files that explain the wasted sixty-five billion Egyptian pounds that left the Bank of Egypt and the People’s Bank as loans to Gamal Mubarak’s men without guarantees? Where are the files on the ousted president’s family, who are constantly shopping in Paris at the expense of the state and in collusion with Ahmad Shafiq? And where are the files on the issue of international bribery (Mercedes) that the ousted president and Kamal Shazly were involved in? And where…? And where…? And where…?,It is evident that after the revolution of January 25th, Jawdat al-Malt is continuing a policy of covering up for these corrupt individuals. He is doing this either out of sympathy for them, because he was part of their system, out of his duty to fulfill their orders, or in an attempt to hide his complicity in protecting them.,Just as experts in the struggle against corruption from among honorable Egyptians confirm that this man is in possession of many, many corruption files that have been classified “Secret Protection.” These files, if brought to light, would discuss at length all the key players in the former regime. They would also representing concrete proof, condemning the corrupt individuals, preventing them from escaping justice, and helping Egyptians of modest means get back the rights that were stolen from them and the money that was raided from them.,We therefore present this statement to instruct Jawdat al-Malt, the president of the Central Auditing Agency, to either disclose these files and documents without delay, or resign immediately from his post to enable the nomination of someone who is honest and able to assume the responsibility of this position.,We therefore call all of the country’s children, foremost among them the staff of the Central Auditing Agency, together with the revolutionary forces and political actors in Egypt, to the first protest rally to fulfill our demands. It will commence on the afternoon of Saturday, May 28, 2011 in front of the Central Auditing Agency from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm.,It is the responsibility of all sincere Egyptians, all those who are the children of this nation and care about the future of Egypt, to show up and participate, in order to realize justice and the reclamation of rights—for Egypt has been liberated—and its people will not let their rights slip away from them ever again.,,The National Front for Justice and Democracy,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,Supervisors Against Corruption,","Calls to Protest, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165005im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/protestsinfrontof.png,imgID253,

A Very Important Proposal from the Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution in the City of Matai–al-Minya,2011-07-20,2011,"A Very Important Proposal from the Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution in the City of Matai–al-Minya,,Regarding the government’s continued response that it is unable to dissolve the local councils and dismiss the governors and mayors and all those affiliated with the National [Democratic] Party for lack of replacements, we say there is a replacement and a radical solution to all these problems, and firstly the problems of the constitution or elections, which is to establish a “Trade Unions’ Shura Council.” In brief, the system is based on:,1. It is based on the trade unions where, in Egypt, one finds approximately 15 trade unions that comprise all sectors of society. Egypt is divided into more than 220 electoral districts, and two trade union members are elected in each district, meaning 2 x 15 = 30 members of different trade unions choosing 2 candidates to represent them in the “Trade Unions’ Shura Council,” which comprises 220 x 2 = 440 members, giving this council the same authorities and purview as the American Senate. The remainder in each governorate comprises a local council for the governorate, meaning the governorate, in which there are 10 districts x 28 = 280 members, who choose:,First: the governors. Second: the mayors and their deputies. Third: local councils of the governorate. Fourth: local city councils. Fifth: trade union members in each governorate. Sixth: trade union members at a national level. All of this could be accomplished in two months from opening the door to candidacy to choosing the members and giving us a strong council and governors and mayors and local councils by election. Elections will allow each citizen, using his national ID, to vote in one trade union only and computers will be used in the polling place and the home. After that, elections for the “People’s Assembly and the presidency” will be held and the authorities and purview of the People’s Assembly and the presidency will be reduced.,,The Demands of Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution in Matai–al-Minya,1. That the trial of Husni Mubarak and all of his associates from among the previous ministers be public and revolutionary, meaning seizing of their assets and punishing them for the killing of [the revolution’s] martyrs.,2. A government of technocrats must be found from those who did not work with the old regime, and these are a great many in Egypt. They should not have personal ambitions and they will work without pay, in our service and for this nation which gave them so much.,3. Purging the interior [ministry] of officers and those responsible for the killing of martyrs and their speedy executions. Dissolving central security, “the long arm of the interior [ministry].”,4. A speedy solution to the unemployment problem through the establishment of mega projects, investment projects, and new areas of construction to direct the budget toward solving this problem.,5.

The martyrs’ families and their supporters organized this gathering in order to protest the relaxed nature of and delay in the trials of those who killed revolutionaries. The use of tear-gas, rubber bullets, and shotgun shells to strike the protesters marks a return to the repressive styles of the police prior to January 28th and led to the injury of a large number of the protestors – including some members of our party. Furthermore, it forced the protestors to respond in kind to that brutal display of force.,,The Party of the Alliance – of which a large number of its members are currently participating in the sit-in in Tahrir – confirms that the masses located in the Square are the youth of the revolution who jealously guard Egypt and the January Revolution. Moreover, the Party condemns the abandonment of these youth by the political powers and media agencies that accuse some of them of being thugs just because they come from the poor of this country—that is, from the overwhelming majority of Egyptians. This situation marks a continuation of the classist system to which the Egyptian poor were exposed during their participation in the revolution. It begins with the media ignoring their martyrs as if the martyrs of the revolution were only from the well-off classes and ends with the pressuring of the martyrs’ families to abandon their rights due to the disregarding and criminalizing of the revolution’s social and economic demands.,,As a response to this brutal return of police activities, the Party of the Alliance announces its endorsement of and support for the revolutionaries participating in open sit-ins in different squares of Egypt until the following demands are realized:,,The Ministry of the Interior’s continued use of the same repressive styles used by Mubarak’s regime coupled with the silence of ‘Isam Sharaf’s government and the Military Council will give the revolutionaries no choice but to insist on completing and defending their revolution through all possible means. To that end, we confirm that the Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance will continue the struggle amid the masses of Egyptians against the brutal, repressive practices of the police under Sharaf’s government as we previously struggled against those the practices of Mubarak’s police. Moreover, our party will continue this struggle with all the forces that demand the completion of the revolution and working to get hold of all the demands that have been brought forth, both political and social.,Revolution until Victory,,71 Nubar St. – Bab al-Luq – [phone # redacted],www.egyleftparty.com,","Politics, The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151737im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/6-29-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%8A-0.png,imgID257,

This deterioration was reflected in the performance of its official and non-official organizations, until it reached the Egyptian value system as a whole, breaching the very foundation of the social contract between the country and its citizens.,,The absence of the separation of powers, especially between the legislative and executive powers, together with the simultaneous growth of the ruling party’s and state’s roles not only in leadership, but also in exploiting all of the country’s natural and human resources, polarizing them in order to serve the interests of the NDP, which was in power at that time—all of these factors led to the NDP’s complete control over political life and, consequently, economic life, excluding any visions, thoughts, and initiatives that were not in line with the interests of the party’s leaders. This situation resulted in the marginalization of large segments of both the elite and ordinary citizens and produced weak and awkward policies. These policies, in turn, caused a large part of Egypt’s resources to be wasted, its sources of power squandered, and its time wasted. They also caused a regression in the economic growth rate which has led to a slowing of Egypt’s development.,,The Party’s Vision,“Helping Egypt take its place among the ranks of the developed nations founded on science and knowledge, in which citizens enjoy all of their legitimate rights without discrimination in an environment run by rule of law, freedom and democracy.”,,The Party’s Principles,The “Development and Renaissance” party holds to six principles, which are reflected in its goals, platform, methods, and work. These principles are as follows:,,The Party’s Goals,The “Development and Renaissance” party, operating under the slogan “The January 25th Renaissance,” aims to work towards a scientific and economic renaissance in Egypt that will make complete development a reality. It seeks to reclaim Egypt’s role as a leader of culture and enlightenment in the Arab world and on the African continent.,,It aims to do this through:,,The Party’s Platform,Operating within the framework of its principles and goals, the party aims to implement its program, which is made up of the following eight parts:,,,,,,Development and Renaissance Party,6 Bank of Egypt St.- from Sharif St.- in front of the Central Bank- 4th floor, apt. 8,Contact Info: cell-[phone # redacted] — e-mail- [e-mail redacted],Our Facebook page: “Development and Renaissance Party”,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164926im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/growthanddev.png,imgID261,

"Until Victory, No. 3: The Popular Socialist Alliance Party",2011-07-11,2011,"UNTIL VICTORY,————-,An occasional publication issued by the Popular Socialist Alliance party—Number 3—May 2011,————-,Our Ongoing Revolution,,More than three months have passed since the fall of the tyrant Mubarak. Egyptians awaited just punishment for him and his gang, as they awaited fulfillment of the demands of the revolution.,,The waiting lengthened, Mubarak was not tried, and the demands were not met, so it was necessary to descend in a second Friday of Rage.,,It was natural for Egyptians to be angry, because instead of Mubarak’s trial, reports echoed with the intention to pardon him and release his wife because she had relinquished a few morsels. Then, finally, he and his sons were brought before the criminal court, without confidence from the people in the outcome of the trial. And instead of speedy trials for the main figures of the corrupt regime, civilians were transferred to military courts, and immediate judgments were issued against them.,,Egyptians went out on the twenty-fifth of January for the sake of change, freedom, and social justice. Which of these demands has been realized? Only the fall of the head of the regime. But the regime did not change, and their lives did not change. Instead of freedom, the emergency law continues to operate without any talk of lifting it. And instead of social justice, a law criminalizing protests is issued that forbids workers and employees from even demanding their rights and defending them. And instead of adopting a minimum wage, those responsible spew upon us fabricated numbers regarding the deterioration of the economic situation in Egypt after the revolution, that we might refrain from demanding any betterment of our living conditions.,,In short, nearly nothing changed, with the exception of the Egyptians’ confidence in their collective ability. They have made a revolution, and they are able to complete it.,,Hundreds have paid with their lives—a heavy price—to change the lives of millions, so at least let them not have lost their lives in vain.,,We have all learned by experience that revolution is not an excursion, but rather a difficult and arduous process, but it is worth it. Because of all this, it was necessary for us to come out today to complete our revolution and safeguard it.,,And just as we came out on the twenty-fifth and refused to go home until Mubarak fell, so today we come out with the same insistence on realizing our demands, affirming that our revolution will continue until they have all been met.,—————,Tura1 is calling, and its words are strong … Prison cells for the thieves,(one of the chants from the square),—————,Customary Reconciliation … Reconciliation or Injustice?,,There have been repeated incidents of assaults against churches or Christian citizens in the period following Hosni Mubarak’s deposition, and it has drawn attention that nearly none of these assaults have been addressed by the normal judiciary but rather by traditional reconciliation councils.,,Among the most prominent of these cases are the traditional reconciliation that took place after the destruction of the church of Sul in Atfih and after the aggression against the citizen of Qina named Ayman Dimitry.,,We affirm our rejection of these councils or traditional sittings. For the traditional sittings may be useful if two neighbors are quarreling over a water source and one of them attacks the other. Then the two sides see that “one should not make light of loyal companionship”2 and “we shouldn’t drag each other back and forth to trial”3 so they choose a respected person in the community to mediate between them on a clear and just basis. But this differs from the traditional reconciliation councils that we see in sectarian incidents, those we saw during Mubarak days under the sponsorship of the State Security apparatus, and those that are now the responsibility of the military governor in the region where the incidents take place. For these “councils” consist of little more than a sitting of humiliation for the victim, and their result is the release of the offender without any punishment that will ensure against his repeating his actions.,,At the end of this past March, the citizen Ayman Dimitry was severely beaten and his ear cut at the hands of a group of thugs who anointed themselves with the name of Islam and accused him with arbitrary charges of bad behavior, applying these penalties to him as though the community did not have police or prosecutors. This citizen presented his statement to the relevant bodies and reported descriptions and names of those who assaulted him and effected these injuries on his body, only to change them later, in front of the prosecutor, all so that he could sit amidst the shaykh, the priest, the military governor of Qina, and the assailant who refused to even utter the word apology.,,It is strange that the Shaykh of al-Azhar met with the victim after the incident and promised him a cosmetic surgery procedure in the al-Azhar hospitals (but performed at his own expense), but failed to demand the punishment of the offender.,,What might push Ayman or other citizens to accept this council other than fear for oneself or one’s children?,,We saw the same thing before with the destruction of the church of Sul in Atfih in the beginning of this past March. We saw popular shaykhs accept an agreement whereby the church was rebuilt without any punishment, material or symbolic, for the people responsible for its destruction, whether by incitement and fabricating rumors (like a rumor that sorcery was taking place inside the church) or actual destruction.,,Is this the Egypt that we want? A state in which the strongest slander the weakest and the majority the minority? Or a state of law in which all are held accountable, and he who errs is held accountable and punished?,,How will there be a solution?,,It is the state’s responsibility to safeguard its citizens via its apparatuses. It is my right to be protected by the state from the tyranny of those stronger than me when I exercise my natural right by presenting a complaint against he who causes me harm, just as it is my right that the prosecutor file criminal charges against those who committed crimes of violence, even if the victim relinquishes his right, for this is society’s right, not his right alone.,,Religious authorities, with the respect that they have in society, should halt their participation in these traditional meetings. For it is not permissible that a shaykh who has popularity and respect among the people should sit in reconciliation—in the place of Muslim youths whose actions are offensive to all Muslims—so as to bring about reconciliation between these youths and the victim. It is as though the shaykh were encouraging such youths to continue undertaking such offensive actions.,————,Which Civil State Do We Want?,,There is no alternative to a civil state.. We want a civil state. Suddenly, the the civil state we have long called for has turned into a demand of all… A demand even of those who used to libel us with apostasy if they heard us calling for it. A demand of those who saw us as just a few people attempting to undermine stability, impeding the wheels of progress.,,Due to our lack of confidence in the method of sudden transformations and taking on the colors that suit the game at the time, it was necessary for us to declare which civil state we want, because we are sure that the hackneyed use of the word is only for the purpose of emptying it of its true content, rendering it superficial and thereby subverting its objective and pushing it onto the path of their counter-revolution’s opportunistic interests.,,The civil state that we mean and call for is a state that knows nothing other than the law, a state that guarantees the political, economic, and social rights of all, without an eye toward placing one group before another, or any one group’s monopolizing authority, concentrating the revolution in its own hands, or thinking that they hold the original catalog of a better life.,,It is a state of participation, coexistence, and security for all its citizens on the basis of a completely equal system, a just system that does not discriminate against the Copts, does not subjugate women, does not marginalize the Nubians, does not betray and alienate the bedouins, and does not deny any rights to any group with different customs or to those who subscribe to a doctrine different from the predominant one.,,It is a state that takes into account the social dimension of its residents, that meets the demands for minimum and maximum wage limits, and provides humane living conditions, from clean housing and education to free health insurance, without linking this to the extent of the flow of billions businessmen’s bank accounts.,,It is a state that stands with the masses of laborers and farmers in their necessary struggles to improve working conditions and raise the standard of living.,,It is a state within which the beneficiaries of the public’s enthusiasm do not use religious propaganda in order to gather a greater following and transform the power of that following into electoral votes, thereby raising themselves to the height of legislative authority in order to seek laws that increase the poverty of the workers and ties the hands of the downtrodden with regard to the freedom to form unions and associations to defend their interests.,,It is a state whose ballot box rewards those who speak about everyone, who place the interests of the broadest sectors of society in their sights, not those who want to benefit from their investments.,,That is the civil state that we want. A state that deals with us as citizens, not as subjects, dhimmis,4 or a strata that lives to serve the interests of another class that posseses greater numbers, wealth, or the absolute truth.,,Muhammad ‘Atif,————,The Fires of Sectarianism Beset the Revolution,So Let Us Struggle For a Society Without Discrimination,,Once again, Egypt is witnessing a crime of violence against the Copts, against the background of a rumor—uncomfirmed—of a church’s detention of a Christian woman who had converted to Islam.,,And thus the picture of political unity and cohesion on the part of Egyptians of different backgrounds and beliefs against oppression and injustice that was shown during the eighteen days that preceded Mubarak’s deposition recedes, to be replaced by a different, ugly picture of sectarian fires, literally burning the Church of the Virgin in the Imbaba neighborhood, and about to devour the Mar Mina Church in flagrant violation of the sanctity of houses of worship. And injustice unmistakable to the eyes of Egyptian Christians. The revolutionary forces that sought to eliminate corrupt and totalitarian one-party rule—by a single individual in a police state, even—today face the reactionary beast that was set loose during the period of the referendum. This vote encouraged many to resort to sectarian mobilization and hate speech against Egyptian Copts in broad daylight, from many minbars and mosques, and on banners hung in the streets in full view of everyone, without the slightest interference or even reservation from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which issued statements threatening Egypt’s workers and its hard-working employees because of their demands for the most simple rights for a decent life in which the most minimal human needs are met.,,What came to pass in Egypt after the revolution in terms of inflamed sectarian conflict cannot be viewed in isolation from the desperate attempts of the counter-revolution to intimidate the people and place them between two choices, the sweetest of which is bitter: either accept oppression, theft, torture, and exploitation, or accept chaos, violence, and sectarian conflict. And in this situation, it is necessary to firmly address all the forces of counter-revolution that have doubtless played an essential role in using the most recent event to incite violence against the Copts. But it is not possible to address this danger through more repression. This confrontation requires adherence to the values of justice and transparency, as far removed as possible from the military and exceptional trials that disregard the rights of the accused by interfering with witnesses and the provision of defense. Likewise, this danger will not be confronted by traditional reconciliation councils that force Coptic victims to renounce their rights and deprive the public of an understanding of incidents’ circumstances, counting on a bright future that never comes.,,The appearance of those who instigated and executed the incidents of Imbaba and other sectarian crimes before an independent just judiciary, impartial and transparent, would confine and limit the Salafi and religious forces—whether organizations or shaykhs—that toy with the crises of poor Muslims and describe to them that the cause of their misery is another segment of the proletariat, the Copts. As though the poverty in the slums, displacement from the factories, torture in the prisons, the invalidation of the citizen’s dignity in the street, unemployment, and poverty ever discriminated between Muslim and Christian or between woman and man.,,The success of the great Egyptian people’s revolution continues to depend on the realization of complete equality between the Copts of Egypt and its Muslims, in employment, building houses of worship, and all aspects of life. This success will not be realized other than through shared struggle on the part of Egyptians, Muslim and Christian, against all those who want to preserve the old regime and all the discrimination, tyranny, and exploitation that came along with it.,————,Say it loudly, O Son of the Nile … The Qur’an alongside the Bible,(one of the chants from Tahrir Square),————,The Doctors’ Strike and the Revolution That Was Not Completed,,What do the doctors want? This question has been repeated often since doctors announced their partial strike, and some imagined that their main objective is a “wage increase,” and that they made the decision to go on strike with no regard for the interests of the sick. But nothing could be further from the truth.,,Doctors are demanding an increase in the health budget from three to fifteen percent, the dismissal of the minister of health and the corrupt leaders in the ministry, a just wage structure, and hospital insurance. These are revolutionary demands par excellence, and their implementation is necessary for massive social transformation—because the revolution has extended beyond political demands to affect the social dimension. The completion of the revolution demands, in reality, that we also realize our social, and not only political, demands so that millions feel change and real improvement in the conditions of their lives.,,And because doctors serve and express the interests and aspirations of millions among this people’s modest and poor, and because the present regime is not interested in the people’s lives, their health, or their aspirations, those who provide this service and meet their demands are presently of no concern to the ruling regime.,,It was necessary for doctors to use the weapon of the strike to achieve their demands, after exhausting all other means, from vigils to sit-ins to negotiating delegations, all to no use. But in order to safeguard the interests of the sick we decided that the strike would be partial and not include emergencies and critical conditions.,,We went on strike to expose the lies of free treatment and obsolete services, and to stand up against the corrupt ministry and the regime that is not interested in the illness and pain of millions of Egyptians. And because the goal of the strike is primarily the provision of appropriate health care to the sick poor, victory in this battle will not happen except by gathering together all those of modest means to defend their right to life and treatment alongside the right of doctors to a decent life.,,These poor are our people, and it is our responsibility to defend their lives and their health. Our battle is the battle of all those who have no treatment other than in public hospitals that have fallen into ruin. Our battle now is against the remnants of the regime and not against our people.

Egyptians awaited just punishment for him and his gang, as they awaited fulfillment of the demands of the revolution.,,The waiting lengthened, Mubarak was not tried, and the demands were not met, so it was necessary to descend in a second Friday of Rage.,,It was natural for Egyptians to be angry, because instead of Mubarak’s trial, reports echoed with the intention to pardon him and release his wife because she had relinquished a few morsels. Then, finally, he and his sons were brought before the criminal court, without confidence from the people in the outcome of the trial. And instead of speedy trials for the main figures of the corrupt regime, civilians were transferred to military courts, and immediate judgments were issued against them.,,Egyptians went out on the twenty-fifth of January for the sake of change, freedom, and social justice. Which of these demands has been realized? Only the fall of the head of the regime. But the regime did not change, and their lives did not change. Instead of freedom, the emergency law continues to operate without any talk of lifting it. And instead of social justice, a law criminalizing protests is issued that forbids workers and employees from even demanding their rights and defending them. And instead of adopting a minimum wage, those responsible spew upon us fabricated numbers regarding the deterioration of the economic situation in Egypt after the revolution, that we might refrain from demanding any betterment of our living conditions.,,In short, nearly nothing changed, with the exception of the Egyptians’ confidence in their collective ability. They have made a revolution, and they are able to complete it.,,Hundreds have paid with their lives—a heavy price—to change the lives of millions, so at least let them not have lost their lives in vain.,,We have all learned by experience that revolution is not an excursion, but rather a difficult and arduous process, but it is worth it. Because of all this, it was necessary for us to come out today to complete our revolution and safeguard it.,,And just as we came out on the twenty-fifth and refused to go home until Mubarak fell, so today we come out with the same insistence on realizing our demands, affirming that our revolution will continue until they have all been met.,—————,Tura1 is calling, and its words are strong … Prison cells for the thieves,(one of the chants from the square),,",Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152212im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hataal-nasr.png,imgID273,

The Culture of the Revolution,2011-07-05,2011,"The Culture of the Revolution,,E-mail: saqafatelsawra@yahoo.com,,Dr. Mustafa Tal’at,,al-Mansura * Issue #1,,Maybe you will agree with me that the essence of revolution is an upheaval in concepts and ideas and its resultant change in circumstances, methods, programs, policies, plans, styles, and ways. All of this is in turn reflected in the individual and society. If an upheaval in concepts and ideas is not realized, then the revolution will not reach its desired goal, despite its overthrow of the former regime. People will remain in the same condition as they were before, or they will yearn for what they achieved a long time ago, or the great mass and majority of people will form a pressuring force on the revolutionary class that truly changed and caused change. Consequently, the matter of the revolution becomes limited to the substitution of one person with another, or the changing of some laws. However, as an escape from this dilemma and a means of securing the final success of the revolution, what if we proposed new revolutionary ideas for the revolutionary vanguard to adopt and learn from and for the great multitude of this ancient people to rally around? This is so that they may act as a leader in the advance which leads them onward, as a river into which the others pour, and a stronger and more general current to which the laggards flock. Those who study history realize that movements of reform, revolution, and change begin with an upheaval in ideas and concepts. The ideas that we promote need attentive minds, clever hearts, a daring soul, and youthful zeal, all of which are amply found (praise God) in the revolutionary vanguard that believed in the necessity of change and used the principle of revolution as a method to realize this goal. This principle suited the present circumstances, as it was a brilliant success by every measure. And to you, free revolutionaries – accept what is human, since you are the first to whom I turn with my request, so that you may fill pages of glory beyond your glory, and that your revolution may be destined for leadership in the two worlds.,Hear it from me loud, echoing from the horizon and filling the seven heavens: “Movement, whatever its outcome, is better than sitting idle and being silent.” Movement is the rule in this existence, while idleness and calm are the accidental and contingent exception. So, respecting the necessary rule because it is consistent with sound instinct, every movement is good and beneficial whatever its outcome. Reality confirms this and our blessed revolution confirms this despite the fact that one group was attacking the revolutionaries and twisting the necks of Qur’anic verses and hadith in order to dampen their spirits—a group which is now applauding the revolution. This is also despite the fact that another group hides behind every disaster that strikes the ummah as though distancing itself from any entanglement in civil strife. These are the ones who do not deserve to be in the first ranks of either civil or religious leadership. As God (to Whom belongs greatness and might) said about the People of the Cave: {When they stood up and said: “Our Lord is Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth”}[1] what was the use of the expression {when they stood up} here? It is a stance. The phrase {They said: “Our Lord”} is speech. They combined their practical stance with speech, so thereby deserved God’s providence. How precise, how wise, how sublime, and how knowing! The shame of it is that people given over to sentiment do not take a stance against these aforementioned groups, and so the state of the clerics who led the ummah astray in the past era will not be reformed. The people are led to positions directed by these clerics, by way of advising and of commanding the right and forbidding the wrong, but they will be brought around to the truth and made to reconsider their views so that they know, however much the clerics may contravene the truth, the ummah will not come to a consensus upon an error.,Another group hides within itself what God makes manifest and fears to show that it rejects the revolution as it waits to see what it will lead to. Should the revolution succeed, they would say: “Were we not with you?” If it fails, they would say: “We told you that repeatedly, and you did not share our principles or our wariness of it!” They have started to deceive themselves and say, despite their late emergence in support of the revolutionaries: “We are not coming out against the ruler!” We say: studies and scientific researches have proven that the child or the human being that moves often develops more knowledge and experience, is quicker to grow and mature, more able to bear responsibility, more aware, and more self-reliant and independent in his character.,We will even go farther than that and say: “Movement, even if error issues from it, is better than sitting idle and being silent.” This is because man does not learn what is right or grasp the truth and does not reach the utmost level of admonition or comprehension, except when he falls into error. At that point he learns not only that this conduct and behavior is wrong but he also that this path leads to error. Therefore he avoids it from then on.,But if he kept sitting still and makes no mistakes, that does not mean that his condition is good, because if he were exposed to any situation, he would not know how to behave, make the correct decision, or form a new opinion about the possibilities of action, because no prior knowledge or experience had been formed within him. We say this, and by the word “error” we mean any unsound conduct or behavior, even if it is a sin. We learn this clearly from the story of our father Adam’s (peace be upon him) creation, when God said to his angels: {“Verily, I am about to place one in my stead on earth,” they [the angels] said, “Wilt thou place there one who will do ill therein and shed blood, when we celebrate thy praise and extol thy holiness?” God said, “Verily, I know what ye know not.”}[2] … It is as though God (may He be praised!) is saying to them “what you claim is ill upon the earth and bloodshed, and what you consider a reason for his unfitness to hold this position in God’s stead on earth is precisely what qualifies him and nominates him to be in God’s stead, being in His stead and cultivating the earth require moral lessons and knowledge that cannot be acquired except through actions that are subject to both right and wrong, success and failure, steadfastness and surrender.” This is why the answer was confounding to them. {“I know what ye know not.”} Then the applied scientific lesson for this idea came when God placed Adam in His paradise and allowed him all the fruits therein save one, in order to accustom him to the content of the divine method (“thou shall” and “thou shalt not”).,Then when he erred and ate from the tree, he learned how to repent and return to his Lord after the commission of error. And when he had become accustomed to this, God lowered him onto the earth. This method that He presented to Adam is the very same method that He has presented to us (“thou shall” and “thou shalt not”), and we must learn the lesson: {And we said, “O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye plentifully there from wherever ye list; but to this tree come not nigh, lest ye become of the transgressors.” But Satan made them slip from it, and caused their banishment from the place in which they were. And we said, “Get ye down, the one of you an enemy to the other: and there shall be for you in the earth a dwelling-place, and a provision for a time.” And words of prayer learned Adam from his Lord: and God turned to him; for He loveth to turn, the Merciful. We said, “Get ye down from it, all together: and if Guidance shall come to you from me, whoso shall follow my guidance, on them shall come no fear, neither shall they be grieved: But they who shall not believe, and treat our signs as falsehoods, these shall be inmates of the fire; in it they shall remain forever.”}[3],Notice that after He finished the story of Adam and lowered him to earth, He mentions the company of those who are rightly guided and of those who disbelieve in order to demonstrate to you that the story of Adam is the story of mankind as a whole.,We are not calling on people to commit sins and disobedience – God forbid! But we are human and sin is inescapably found among us, so we do not dread falling into it.,As for those who made every effort to balance personal advantage and corrupt actions, they claimed that rising up against the ruler was certain corruption and held no advantage. But the revolution has shown just how unable they are to reach such a balance. Likewise, the revolution has exposed those who lagged behind and tried to thwart it, saying to them: “Sit with the women who are staying behind at home and the others who are home-bound!”[4],But rather, women are better because they at least went outside! And they proved how greatly mistaken were those who retreated from their revolutionary logic. God cast our truth against their falsehood and overcame it, and behold it is perishing.[5] Even if they were to come to their senses and catch up with the march, the revolutionaries would still have the rights of superiority and precedence.,The revolution has also torn off the veil sheltering those who inquire after the blood of gnats while they overlook the blood of Muslims and investigate the theft of four dinars while they overlook the theft of thousands of acres and millions of pounds…,The broad swath of Muslims are occupied and preoccupied with consequences and finding solutions for them while they play blind and dumb about the causes and origins of corruption.,Forward, revolutionaries – with God’s blessing! {[F]or God is with you, and will not defraud you of the recompense of your works}.[6],[1] Qur’an 18:14,[2] Qur’an 2:30,[3] Qur’an 2:35-39,[4] Refers to Qur’an 9:84: “sit ye at home, then, with those who lag behind.”,[5] Refers to Qur’an 21:18: “Nay, we will hurl the truth at falsehood, and it shall smite it, and lo! it shall vanish.”,[6] Qur’an 47:35,",Culture,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130170253im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/scaled.%D8%AB%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9.png,imgID279,
"Muslim and Copt, Hand in Hand",2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 4],Muslim and Copt Hand in Hand..For the Sake of the New Beginning We Are Creating,[Figure text: Stand with the revolution against sectarianism!],A few days ago, the revolutionaries were able to teach State Security a new and unforgettable lesson when they stormed its special headquarters in Nasr City, Shubra and Alexandria, as well as in many other provinces. However, it is clear that this repressive apparatus did not take notice, for today it is plotting its revenge on the revolutionaries and the abortion of their revolution using the most dangerous weapon it possesses..the weapon of sectarian strife.,It is not the first time that the dogs in the Ministry of the Interior have used this weapon. In fact, strife was one of the traditional means used to divide the populace, Muslims and Christians, in the era of the dictator Mubarak. We can only remember how central intelligence forces hit Christians and destroyed Al-’Amrania Church before the Parliamentary elections last November, which coincided with a wave of hysteria to attack the Copts in the government-funded media. The goal of this was as clear as daylight, for the regime did not want Muslim unity. Additionally, the recent burning of the church in Atfiah, and the murderous actions that occurred against Copts in Manshi’at Nasr, are aiming only to split the ranks of the revolutionaries into Christians and Muslims. It is not possible that what is being stated here is only a slur or allegation against the Ministry of the Interior, for it is the Ministry that planned the bombing of the Qadisin Church and that tried to destroy Al-’Amrania Church, etc.,The police made clear their true intentions as soon as they descended into the street. They want to get revenge on citizens and to make the revolutionaries kneel before them. This was apparent in the position of the Director of Security in al-Buhayra, and then in the crime at Damanhur prison, and before that at the al-Ma’adi driver incident.,All of this, combined with what we see and hear about the activities of informants and those instigating rumors, whom the Ministry of the Interior assembled rumors against the revolution, and the harassment of peaceful protesters.,Today the revolution faces danger. The Ministry of the Interior is using the filthiest means possible to ignite sectarian strife and split the ranks of the revolutionaries. On the other hand, the revolutionaries rebelled against injustice, tyranny, and poverty, gave their lives, and faced down live fire and thugs, standing shoulder to shoulder. They have remained strong in their sit-ins and strikes, protecting each other and sharing morsels of food amongst themselves. These revolutionaries will face the efforts of the state and the counter-revolution that the Ministry of the Interior and its agents created, and they will overcome them.,For we have undertaken the revolution with the understanding that the unity of the protesters is the only way to victory. We know that the split between Muslim and Christian was only ever due to the regime and in the interest of its remaining in place and maintaining its [firm] grip and domination..We will not allow them to divide our ranks..Our struggle is continuing..Continuing until the all the criminals of Mubarak’s regime are put on trial..and Egypt is cleansed of them.,","Religion, Sectarian Strife",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160418im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID280,

What is the Revolution? What is the Regime?,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 3],What is the Revolution?? What is the Regime??,Beginning on January 25th, the Egyptian masses were stirred awake to announce their revolution against the regime and the people’s desire for its downfall. They succeeded in overthrowing the head of the regime by deposing President Mubarak. Likewise, Ahmad Shafiq’s government fell, and they have now entered their battle against the security apparatus. We do not have to detract from those great achievements, just as we should not be misled by the talk of those say that the regime fell completely merely due to Mubarak’s removal along with some of the regime’s symbols. However, we do need to understand what the regime was and what its role and nature was. The regime is not an unbiased entity, but rather the result of an incompatibility of the interests of the rulers and the ruled. The regime was created in order to impose the authority and interests of the ruling class over the suffering masses, the sons of this people. It is an instrument which allows those who hold the power and wealth to exploit the masses. If we look at the essence of this regime, it consisted of the armed apparatus—the police, State Security, and Central Security, in addition to the army. That whole apparatus was designed to deprive the people of their freedom and to protect only the regime. If we now were to take a look at the situation in Egypt, we would see the regime as it really is. Despite the fact that it sacrificed some of its figureheads, here it is trying to use all of its forces, ferociously, to protect its interests. These victories which we have realized are nothing but concessions that it was forced to make under the pressure of the masses.,Regarding revolution, it does not mean exchanging one ruler with another. Instead, it means a total and complete change in which the former regime is demolished and a substitute emerges from it in harmony with the revolution’s principles. In this case, the regime changes and the ruling authority is replaced by an authority which expresses the public. A change in the distribution of wealth also occurs. In the light of the revolution, the remains of the ruling authority are fighting desperately to keep their power. Even if its repressive apparatus failed in its self-protection, they will try to use the media to spread their opinions. We see the old ruling class trying to convince the masses that the regime fell with Mubarak when he fell. However, this is not true, and the regime is trying once again to convince the masses that it is not possible to change again—as if the authority of this class is unending and as if it would not be possible to change the regime. The counter-revolution promotes these lies to protect the interests of its own class. In reality, the revolution does not happen simply because the majority changed their minds overnight. Rather, these thoughts changed on the level of the masses by way of their struggle. The thoughts changed during the struggle when the masses realized their ability to enact change. They also realized that the toiling classes, ground to bits, had a shared interest in facing off against their leaders. They also realized that the differences the ruling class tried to use to split them do not have any importance. There is no difference between women and men or Muslims and Christians. As an example of this, every day we see attempts to incite sectarian riots in Egypt, such as what happened in the ‘Atfih Church. These must be overcome. Once again, this ruling class is trying to create a security panic amongst the crowds of the masses in order to impose their authority—as if we could not live without them and their apparatus. However, the experience proved that we do not need to use this repressive apparatus to secure our neighborhoods. The role of that apparatus is to protect the ruling minority and to repress the masses. As far as the security of the neighborhoods and the organization of the traffic movement are concerned, we can create more democratic and efficient instruments, able to deal with these matters in a better way. The revolution is not an event that happens on a specific day but is a process of change. If we now want to continue our revolution in order to realize the goals we have not yet achieved, then we have to organize ourselves to face off against the organized enemies of the revolution, the old regime. Our martyrs who gave their lives during the revolution did not do so in order that another ruler could take Mubarak’s place nor to paint the sidewalks. They gave their lives for real change in society—a society with real freedom, free of any kind of repression and oppression, in which wealth is redistributed in order to realize social justice.,,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165248im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID282,
The National Party… The “Devil’s Head” Has Fallen…,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 3],The National Party …“the Devil’s Head” Has Fallen but out of it Emerged a Swarm of Detestable Insects,Throughout the past sixty years – not only the last thirty years under Mubarak’s rule – there were always people who acted in their own personal interests in order to enter into relationships with whomever was in power. They monopolized popular representation, not in order to serve the people, but rather to create a direct connection that would them to take advantage of this link to the authority that, from their point of view, owned everything in this country. Of course it was not strange that “wealth” was the main factor in this alliance. The head of the regime needed those who were always able to finance secret, underhanded operations, the latest—and not necessarily most painful–of these being the Battle of the Camels in Tahrir Square.,We caution and say… those who have tasted the “satanic recipe” for an alliance of wealth, tribalism, and power are still among us. They created a “gang” that they cannot easily abandon, even though the creation of a completely new regime most certainly means opening all the old dossiers and stopping the majority of the projects through which they earned suspicious profits. They still have positions of power and lists of voters’ names, as well as memberships in the local councils, which gives you an idea of their forceful desire to permeate the Egyptian streets yet again in a new way.,The men of the National Party have not stopped “thinking” about “wealth” as an effective medium of influence, not by directly buying votes in front of the voting booths, but rather by trying to lead “the counter-revolution” and “steal all the achievements of the revolution.” For example, we find them announcing the formation of new political parties and bonds with the provinces, projects primarily focused on providing imaginary opportunities for work and housing. They announce that they have opened communication with governors, asking them to provide aid for the families of those who were martyred or wounded in the revolution, who exerted all their energy throughout the eighteen days it took to bring the system down. These men from the National Party are still trying; they organize visits to impoverished popular neighborhoods, jamming up doorsteps with the sheets of their failures, presenting them with nothing but shame and insults.,The picture might be clear to those who understand the reasons and aspirations of this genuinely popular revolution. It is clear to those who understand the role of “the Parliament” in monitoring the regime, offering laws which bring the citizens’ hopes and their attempts to live honorably to fruition. But this “clear picture” still requires a great amount of “revolutionary” effort. It requires that we use all possible means of pressure to blockade this “criminal entity” called the National Party, which for the past thirty years has sullied its hands with the blood of Egyptians through death, decline, dukedom, increased poverty rates, and so on, while their own pockets swelled. There must be a clear demand for the complete dissolution of the National Party, legal prosecution for everyone involved with it, and the “reintegration” of its members into society on several conditions, the first of which being their “accounting” for all their former actions and “careful examination” of all their future ones.,,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165321im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID283,
"State Security, Not Reconciliation",2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 2],State Security..Not Reconciliation,The January 25 Revolution arrived with a quiver filled with a bunch of demands, one of which has been realized: the fall of the main figure of the previous regime, the deposed President Mubarak. But the revolutionaries continue to struggle for the sake of the realization of all of their demands, none of which they will concede. Foremost among these demands is the dissolution of the State , the tool of repression used by the previous regime, after it changed from an apparatus whose duty was the protection of the nation’s security and its citizens to an apparatus whose duty was to protect the president’s security, his entourage and his corrupt inheritor. This terrifying and corrupt apparatus affected not only political life in Egypt, rather, we could say, without exaggeration, that it ruined everything, for the hands of State Security stretched to all Egyptians, and interfered in everything from getting jobs to campaigning for high positions in the state.,The domination of the State Security apparatus reached to everything great and small in Egypt, and affected much more than public action or the censorship of parties and newspapers, and the active resistance of certain political groups in the street. It dominated even economic and fiscal decisions and interfered in the affairs of universities and schools, and mosques and churches, and used the most filthy means to listen in on conversations and rig elections and fabricate issues for the opposition, and demanded money in exchange for protection from even such places as medical centers.,Until State Security’s headquarters was toppled at the hands of the revolutionaries, the apparatus continued its dirty doings, trying to undermine and destroy the revolution. They started by planting rumors that tried, among other things, to spark terror and fear among citizens using the catchphrase “lawlessness.” They supported this claim by organizing bands of thugs and sending them out in a coordinated and organized fashion to all the cities of Egypt, trying to reignite the conflict between Christians and Muslims by fabricating sectarian incidents. Finally, they burned security headquarters and destroyed documents that implicated figures from the previous regime and those who work in State Security. They left some unimportant documents because they contained only information previously known, or because they would turn public opinion against some religious and media figures, in order to cover up the most important crime, which was destroying important documents in a failed attempt to escape accountability, and subsequent punishment.,And after all of this, there are still this who ask “Dissolution or restructuring?,” to which we reply: How can those who are accustomed to criminality, tyranny and ruling the people with threats and torture announce their repentance now? How can we believe this now and feel safe? This apparatus has a black and terrible history filled ,the rights of those who were held in secret prisons and left, forgotten, for years? How can we agree to restructuring the instigator of sectarian conflict and the destroyer of facilities?,Dissolving the State Security Apparatus completely and trying all the elements whose involvement in crimes is proven is the right of the nation and its citizens, and laying off those who worked in this apparatus and re-employing them in non-authoritarian positions is among the demands that the revolution will not give up. The civilian state for which we are struggling cannot exist in the shadow of this putrid apparatus. We will not be fooled by a mere restructuring or swapping of titles. Dissolution and dissolution only is the demand of all the revolutionaries.,,","Regime, Security Forces",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155704im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID284,
"The Emergency Laws, We Will Break Them with Hammers",2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 2],The Emergency Laws…We will break them with hammers,Since the former dictator assumed the position of President of the Republic, Mubarak did not abandon, even for a day, the Emergency Laws by which he snuffed out any political activity that opposed his tyranny. During the past ten years, it was clear that the dictator was using the laws to insure the succession of his son to the presidency without any opposition.,It is known that emergency laws are not invoked except under particular circumstances, such as the outbreak of war, the occurrence of a public crisis or the spread of an epidemic. Egypt is not witnessing any of these issues today, so what justifies the continuance of these laws to this day even after Mubarak, who could not live for even a minute without these laws, was toppled?,When we look at the thirty years during which the state of emergency was enforced, we find that the Emergency Laws were not used even once in the pursuit of those who were corrupt or for punishing those who stole the people’s money. On the contrary, because of these laws, the dictator kept more than 30,000 of those who opposed him in detention centers and internal cells, at a time when the governmental media and the men close to Mubarak were describing his era as “The Brightest Age of Democracy.”,Mubarak used the Emergency Laws not only against the Opposition, but also in order to terrorize every citizen so that they would not dare to demand their right to a better society in which they could live humanely and speak their mind to those in power. e Emergency Laws gave the Ministry of the Interior extra powers in order to suppress the people. In this way, it became natural, in accordance with these laws, for citizens to be stopped and arrested without any charges.,In spite of this, the media is still promoting the false idea that we are in dire need of such laws. Regarding the news agencies that linger on the armed thugs in some of the streets of Cairo, those thugs were, in short, raised up by the Ministry of the Interior and its men. It is the Ministry of the Interior that holds the reins of those who terrorized the revolutionaries, to justify extending the Emergency Laws until this day. The men from the Ministry of the Interior desire to subjugate the people.,After this the people got their revenge on the men of the Interior, who got their just deserts for what they inflicted upon our rights. That is, torture, repression, and terrorism.,For the people toppled the dictator Mubarak and threw him into the trash, we must also throw his laws, which repressed us for thirty long years, into the trash. We must also remember that the revolutionaries do not thrive except through revolution, just as repression does not thrive except through special laws. Such was Mubarak thriving before. The revolutionaries have the legitimacy of the revolution, whereas repression has the Emergency Laws.,The toppling of the Emergency Laws was among those demands of the Revolution that we cannot let go or neglect, for this will never be a democracy without toppling of these laws. They are choking political life in Egypt. There can be no talk of a democratic transformation while these laws, which protect the power of the Ministry of the Interior, stand against the people.,,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151602im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID285,
The Presidential Council: The Way to Democratic Transition,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 2],The Presidential Council,The Way to Democratic Transition,The military council is insisting on following steps to transfer power in accordance with a fixed plan and a limited period of time even as the voices of many are demanding a review of these steps, just as the council is insisting on adhering to the constituent assembly’s mandate to amend only certain articles of the constitution, willfully ignoring the demands of the revolution.,Likewise, the council is being hasty in its call for a public referendum on all of the articles of constitution at one time. Rather than [holding a referendum] for each individual article, despite the presence of a number of objections to some of the amendments and despite the fact that the absolute power of the President of the Republic is not curtailed, allowing for the creation of a Pharaoh anew.,And the question is not just how it is possible to call for a referendum in light of the current state of instability, but also how it is possible to do so in light of what appears to be a complete refusal from those of all different persuasions of the military council’s plan and the situation that it has forced upon us. That is, putting the constitutional amendments to a yes-no vote in the referendum on the 19th of March, followed by Parliamentary elections, followed directly by the election of president. This is in order to call upon the new president to form an assembly from the Parliamentarians to draft the constitution, and then to put the constitution to a popular referendum. All of the steps outlined above are going to take place in six months so that the army can return to its barracks.,The powers of the revolution confirm the danger of the scenario the military has envisioned for the transitional period for a number of reasons. Among them is that the Mubarak-era constitution fell for all intents and purposes after the revolution, when Mubarak turned over power to the military council. This is a historical opportunity to draw on the revolutionary legitimacy to create a new constitution that pushes political life and the rights of the citizens to the forefront and creates some sort of balance between the powers of the president, the administration,Parliament and the Judiciary.,The current measures for the new Parliamentary elections protect the same forces and parties from an obsolete era in Parliament. In light of the Muslim Brotherhood’s promise―which is widely doubted―of their aspirations for only a third of Parliamentary seats, we expect that capital and the idea of the servile role of the representative―not his political role―will be utilized in the interest of preserving the remnants of the National Democratic Party or the cartoonish opposition parties, who are professionals regarding elections.,Just as the absence of opportunity for the presidential candidates from the forces of the revolution will push forward faces from the previous regime (like Amr Moussa).,This means that the military council will likely lead to the convolution of the revolution and the gradual hijacking and draining of its goals.,And so we stand together for an alternative path for the revolution:,Creating a temporary presidential council composed of judges or figures chosen by national agreement or elections, to head the transitional period for a period of one year; who will not be permitted to run during the presidential elections immediately following (and who will be civilian, or only partially military), in order to allow the military to return to their barracks,A temporary constitutional proclamation that encompasses the general constitutional principles,Election of a constituent assembly to implement a new constitution,Running of presidential elections, followed by parliamentary elections after one year in order to allow the revolutionary powers to assemble, the public to become aware of the goals of the revolution, and for the defeat of the counter-revolution, which is seeking to harm the nation, so that the Parliament will have patriotic elements representing the people and leading to change,In this way, the Presidential council will realize a peaceful transition to civilian power, just as the transitional period will allow for a society-wide conversation about the new republican system (whether it be parliamentary or presidential) and whether we will be satisfied with only the Sha’b Council as a legislative power, or whether the Shura Council has a real role to play as well, as well as the discussion of many important constitutional issues.,If the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces insists on holding the referendum on March 19, we must go to the polls and vote “No” without any additional comments so that the votes are not discarded, and then continue to work towards realizing the goals of the revolution.,,",Politics,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165056im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID286,
The Popular Committees… with the Revolution against Thuggery,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 1],The Popular Committees… with the Revolution and against Thuggery,The idea for the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution came out of Tahrir Square, where it became clear that there were grave threats trying to abort the principle goal of the revolution, “the people want the fall of the regime.” The first of these threats is the reduction of the revolution to overthrowing some of the leaders of corruption along with the rest of the regime and its policies. The second is in the propaganda hostile to the revolution. Some sections of the Egyptian people are trying to make gains in the interests of the ideas of passivity and patience, the idea that change will be gradually achieved, that we must put our faith in those holding the reins of governance right now. These threats motivated a number of those participating in the Tahrir sit-in to think about organizing themselves in their neighborhoods, intending to complete the revolution, actualize the fall of the corrupt regime, and build a new one based on “freedom, dignity, and social justice.”,Many committees have already been formed in a number of neighborhoods and become active in a raising political awareness by distributing statements and holding public conferences in the streets. The committees succeeded in bringing together a large number of politically conscious families to work together both within these neighborhoods and outside of them. This is happening because the success of the revolution is dependent upon the ability of the people to organize themselves against the corrupt political regime which was governing us and still controls many of the state’s institutions. Additionally, it is managing a propaganda campaign against the revolution, and it is not unlikely that it will have a role in igniting sectarian tension in order to abort the revolution. From here comes the importance of the Committees as popular, not party, organizations aiming to complete the revolution.,The Committees are currently active in the field of outreach due to the seriousness of the constitutional amendments. As can be expected, the political activity has a relationship with subsequent political development, especially with changing the Constitution and presidential and parliamentary elections. These developments demand intensified activity as far as political outreach within the popular neighborhoods because there are real dangers that the businessmen and remnants of the National Party will succeed in entering the houses of Parliament once again by buying votes and providing services.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution aim for the self-organization of neighborhood families to undertake popular oversight of the localities, neighborhoods, governorates, and police stations in order to pressure these institutions to be in the service of the people and not continue the policies of authoritarianism, corruption, and neglect. This oversight can be achieved in various ways, such as collecting signatures, demonstrating, and protesting in front of the headquarters of these institutions. Should the Committees succeed in popular oversight, it will be an obstacle against the continuation of corruption. Additionally, through struggling in these Committees, people from among the sons of the neighborhoods will come forth to be qualified so that they can run as candidates for seats in the elected Local Councils.,The Popular Committees can play important roles in preserving security in case of the continued mutiny of the police force, which refuses to return to the streets under various pretexts. They intend to create a climate of panic thanks to the thuggery which the regime created over the decades. In the future, it is possible for the committees to play other important roles in building the political and social regimes more justly, based on the idea of “bottom-up democracy.”,,",The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151559im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID287,
No to the Constitutional Amendments… No to Patching up the Constitution,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3, Page 1],No to Constitutional Amendments… No to Patching up the Constitution,Next March 19th has been set as the date for the referendum on the prospective constitutional amendments. Their proposed form is under a dark shadow of doubt regarding their faithful response to the demand of the revolution and conviction that Egypt shall not return to the past. The form suggested for these amendments indicates nothing but the continuation of a lack of respect for the mentality of the Egyptian citizen and a lack of interest for his participation in the public affairs of his country. When all the revolutionaries demanded change of the Constitution, their demand was clear and specific—namely, that the fall of the regime does not occur with the fall of just its people but with the fall of the Constitution as well. This is the Constitution which the deposed President published. He tailored its laws through tinkering and modification until he became a god through constitutional authority. He had around 88% of the powers granted to the different state authorities. Is it rational to undertake amending it by the same ridiculously laughable logic? As an example, the suggested form of the amended Article 75 forbids Egyptians married to foreigners from candidacy for the Presidency of the Republic despite the presence of a ruling of the Constitutional Court that this is a private matter of citizens—one that does not require denying them one of their rights. It does not address anything with regard to providing opportunities for Egyptians abroad to cast their votes—those whom the deposed President’s regime exiled and displaced so that they left the country in order to not die of hunger and poverty. The deposed regime excluded them from any type of participation in public life, although the majority of the world’s communities exercise their rights to participate in elections and referendums as if they were in their own countries—not expatriates—by balloting at their own embassies. The Committee for Constitutional Amendments seeks to assure us that it will produce the same the corrupt system which the Egyptians overthrew a few weeks ago since the suggested form for Article 76 repeats the same suspicious requirements of the original text. It gives the oversight committee for the upcoming presidential elections the same absolute powers that were previously granted to it. So, it this reasonable? Add to that the fact that we now know that the members presumed to be on this committee were previously appointed by the deposed President. This means that they were part of his regime, his men, even if the committee has judicial approval. However, each one of them—the head of the Constitutional Court, his deputy, the head of the State Council, the head of the Court of Cassation, and the head of the Cairo Court of Exception—all of them were appointed by the deposed President, Hosni Mubarak. Now they’re asking us to put our faith in this committee? The suggested amendment for Article 148, regarding the imposition of the Emergency Law, is defective and loose since the text has categorically stated the impermissibility of extending the state of emergency for a period of more than six months without having a popular referendum. Still, what about imposing the state of emergency for six months and after it ends imposing it once again for six months and so on?? We note that the suggested form theoretically permits this since the text discusses the extent of the state of emergency and not its re-imposition or imposing it once again. Even worse than that is the fact that the referendum will be held on all of the suggested Articles at once, amending them as a single unit, such that one must agree with or refuse all of them as a group. This is contradictory to even the minimum limits of democracy. Did our children give up their souls as ransom for this country only so that the Military Council could come to impose whatever its leaders want on us rather than what the people want??,[Graphic: No to the constitutional amendments, yes to a new Constitution. The Egyptian Revolution is everlasting. We will not back down after today.],The people did not demand amending the constitution but changing it, because the 1971 Constitution lost its legitimacy when Mubarak lost his legitimacy. It is necessary that there be a new Constitution, coming out of revolutionary legitimacy and not from the Military Council or the Constitutional Drafting Committee which the people did not elect. Rather, it has been imposed upon them by the Council.,This referendum scheduled to be done on the 19th of March is nothing but another attempt to abort the revolution and circumvent its demands. Therefore, the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution call for voting against these suspicious amendments and demands a new Constitution for the country.,,","Constitution, March Referendum",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130154401im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID288,
"Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2",2011-07-04,2011,"Page 1,Logo: “The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution”,Revolutionary Egypt,A progressive publication issued by the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,Volume 2, March 1st, 2011,,Sons of Tahrir … Holding on to the Revolution’s Embers,Those who took to the streets during the 18 days that allowed us to get rid of Mubarak are not the only ones holding onto the revolution’s embers, for there is also,a group of revolutionary young men and women who decided to return to hold sit-ins on Tahrir Square a few days ago. They are asking for the fall of Shafiq’s government, an elected civilian presidential council, and other demands of the revolution which have not yet been met due to a slowdown of their realization and their circumventing by the current power. These young men and women are exposed daily to organized attempts to frighten and terrorize them at the hands of the army, the State Security Investigations Services, and what remains of the National Party. These institutions send hired hands to Tahrir Square, intending to spread rumors and pick fights with these courageous, brave youths.,Despite the stinging cold of winter, these steadfast braves in the square were subjected, night and day, to forceful attempts at dissolving their sit-ins at the hand of the “army” forces. On Friday, the 25th of February, notwithstanding the violence, intimidation, and arrests of some to which they were subjected, they returned to the square the next day, full of enthusiasm and perseverance. With their heads raised they faced off against repression, carrying posters that invited all the Egyptian people to complete their revolution against the not-yet-fallen regime. This regime is trying to keep its figureheads, rebuilding what was before January 25th, trying to cheat us with idle talk like the necessity of “patience” and “giving them a chance”. Yes, they do indeed want a chance. However, it is not an opportunity to realize our demands but rather one to bring back the ranks of Central Security and other forces of oppression. They are doing this so that they will be able to control and destroy the revolution completely.,Every day, our noble people come to Tahrir Square, but so do people who have been “duped” by false propaganda that the regime spreads against those sitting-in and rumors spread by agents of the State Security Investigations Services. They are trying to convince these youths to dissolve their sit-ins, but the youth are truly equipped with the patience and morality of revolutionaries. Our people discuss the necessity of returning to sit-in at Tahrir Square until the demands of the revolution are met and the martyr’s blood, shed by the regime which is still there despite the fall of its head, has been recompensed. They convinced some of our people. They go to their houses, provide them with blankets and tents, and they come to join our revolutionary youth. This way the numbers on Tahrir Square increase every day, as well as the numbers of people convinced of the importance of continuing the battle. These youths are a part of revolutionary Egypt—an Egypt which refuses to return to what was before Januray 25th. Old Egypt is moving forward on the path of justice, freedom, and equality. They actively reflect the saying: “If I would not burn but you would, how should the light ever leave this darkness?”,Our Revolution Continues Until the Fall of the Regime,When the angry masses succeeded in overthrowing Mubarak and forcing him to leave power, the Egyptian Revolution was just announcing its beginning. The fall of the head of the corrupt regime meant the start of a long battle to demolish its staff and tear out its roots in society. Thirty years of tyranny and corruption were enough for the regime to stretch its arms out in all directions, and so the fall of its head is no longer enough. Rather, it has become necessary for the revolution to continue in order to remove those arms and complete the cycle of the revolution by tearing down the former regime, and building a new one. It was upon this principle that the people of the rebellion worked toward establishing the revolution’s bases and roots everywhere, and Committees for the Defense of the Revolution popped up in various neighborhoods, cities and provinces. Workers strove to establish unions and committees in labor sites. These roots and missions are no less important than the heroic struggle fought by the masses from January 25th to February 11th to topple Mubarak. For if the Egyptian Revolution leaves the body of the regime in the provinces, cities, and official establishments, it will sprout a thousand new heads, so as to hijack the revolution. The fight of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution against the appearances of corruption in all parts of Egypt is the best way to weed out the roots of corruption, and the formation of committees for the people everywhere is what will prevent the return of tyranny and persecution to Egyptian streets. The struggle of workers for fair wages and to expose corruption in economic companies and institutions is what prevents any chance of return for the old regime. The movements of the farmers, who are raising their demands in the villages and revealing the persecution from which they have suffered, and how it squandered their rights just as it ruined Egypt’s agricultural wealth for the benefit of a handful of wealthy people, this is what gives back hope in our ability to provide sustenance for ourselves.,The message of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution is clear. No longer will anyone treat our rights as if they were handouts to be grateful for. We will not get any more than what we fight for in this movement. The masses who organize themselves in committees today will be the ones who stand tomorrow in front of those in charge. [They will] demand the publication of the ‘social services’ budget for the cities and neighborhoods, demanding that they be monitored by the true representatives of the people, and that utilities and social services be distributed fairly between the upper and lower class neighborhoods. These are the ones who tomorrow will be able to count the unemployed in the neighborhoods and organize them in a union for the unemployed to demand true work opportunities for their youth or unemployment welfare.,The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which are formed today by the fighters of the rebellion, are a continuous reconstruction of the revolution and its goals everywhere in Egypt, and they are a true guarantee for the protection of the revolution against those who try to destroy it.,,Page 2,No to Military Tribunals,,[Picture text: No to Military Tribunals],Rights organizations, in a press release issued on March 2nd, 2011, condemned the ruling of the military tribunal in the case of ‘Amr ‘Abd Allah ‘Abd al-Rasul al-Buhayri (23 years old), carrying #155 of the year 2011’s Military Crimes East. His guilty verdict was announced on the 1st of March, and he was sentenced to prison for five years for the charge of abusing the cost of public service and breaking the curfew following a period of no more than three days after his arrest. The organizations denounced the transfer of civilians to military tribunals—made up of officers belonging to the army—for non-military crimes. These organizations consider this an infraction of the simplest rights of citizens to fair trials. They emphasized that all the international conventions to which Egypt is a party stress adherence to the standards of fair trials, even in times of emergency, and that the state has no right to abandon this commitment.,The organizations expressed their concern about a number of trials that have gone on during the past weeks since the outbreak of the revolution on the 25th of January 2011. Breaching of principles and international standards has marred the revolution, especially as regards fair and public trials. In many cases, the families of those accused have not been able to visit their kin or find legal counsel to defend them. Even if they had the opportunity for legal counsel, the quickness of these trials does not permit a lawyer time to go over the case and prepare an appropriate defense for the accused. Additionally, the secrecy of the trials increases the seriousness of the situation, for in the majority of cases the date of the trial as well as the location of the accuseds’ detention are not made available to their families until after the verdict is announced.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution view the abolition of trials of civilians before military courts or extraordinary courts as one of the revolution’s demands; we did not demand the repeal of the Emergency Law only to replace it with military tribunals. Both of them are clear signs proving that Mubarak’s regime is not yet finished. Also, they were both among the most prevalent ways to repress the opposition and silence anyone talking about rights in the face of injustice and tyranny.,Was the Regime Only Mubarak?,Oppression, corruption and dictatorship were all important factors in awakening the anger of the Egyptian people and setting off the spark of the revolution. But there was also another reason for the anger. Namely, that the men of this regime were characterized by arrogance, boastfulness and haughtiness, while at the same time the people did not find them at all justified in this hubris.,They treated the people as if they were incompetent, incapable, and totally stupid, therefore deserving of their poverty and humiliation.,The news of the deposed President of the Republic and his family was considered to have priority, no matter how unimportant it was, over the most important Egyptian or world news. Their movements would bring society to a grinding halt, even if only for a journey or short trip to Sharm al-Shaykh.,The government’s newspapers and media addressed members of the opposition with disdain and scorn, neglecting their news completely or referring to it with other names, such as when they referred to the biggest political organization in Egypt as “the prohibited one”.,The fraud in the last elections was obvious, crudely undertaken, and without precedent in the history of elections in Egypt. It reflected apathy and great scorn for the people and their desires. The fraud brought with it a parliament in which the voice of opposition was not represented. So when some opposition figures thought about building a shadow parliament, the President of the Republic commented: “Let them have fun.” This comment demonstrated the extent of his apathy towards the feelings of the people in the face of a sham election. Then came the explosion, and the people’s anger about this degree of arrogance and apathy was definitely among its causes. The people did not find anyone with exceptional intelligence, extraordinary wisdom, or unrivaled skills to administer this country from among these men in charge of the regime: education declined, access to health services for a reasonable price became more and more difficult, unemployment rose, foreign policy did not spring from the national will, and so on.,The question is now: what comes after Mubarak’s dismissal?? Let’s talk a bit about Shafiq’s government. Mubarak substituted a new face from his regime for an old one and placed a minister of the old government as its new president. However, the new Prime Minister, by virtue of his having been a minister for the past six years, is still responsible, along with the rest of the ministers, for the complaints of the people. If he can respond to the people’s wishes now, why did he not make any effort to influence the past government to prevent the anger of the crowds? As far as the rest of the new ministers are concerned, they are nothing but copies of the former ministers. One of them, who was a compliant subordinate of the hated Minister of Culture, happens to be the new Minister of Culture. The former minister insisted on people calling him “The Artistic Minister”. What could it possibly be that the new minister wants people to call him? The Minister of Trade and Manufacturing was the right hand of the former Minister of Trade and Manufacturing. So what kind of change can we expect to occur? The regime as such is determined to deal with the people with the same arrogance and disdain, as though the demonstrators, more than hundreds of whom were young men and women who sacrificed their lives, were demonstrating because they did not have anything else with which to entertain themselves.,Truly the current system consists of a gang controlling Egypt, a league with members everywhere—in every neighbourhood, every city, every county and every governmental agency. The police, arsenal, and weapons of the Interior Ministry are only used to safeguard this gang. The revolution led the gang’s leader to disappear from the picture, but all of its members are still among us. We all have a role in the broad campaign for purification. Disgrace the election-riggers, bring the ones who tortured your sons to trial. Do not be silent about the humiliation again. Only this way will the revolutions join together to defend our revolution.,The People Want a Change of the Constitution, Not Its Amendment,My friend the doctor recently asked me why the majority of the revolution’s leaders insisted on overthrowing Shafiq’s government and forming a national government without any of the leaders of the defunct National Party in addition to changing the constitution rather than amending some of its articles. I told him that for thirty years the regime of corruption has spread in Egypt’s body like a malignant tumor. We are left with no choice but to remove it entirely in order to heal the country. Otherwise, its remaining parts would viciously attack the nation’s body. The more complete its removal, the quicker and more secure the nation’s healing would be.,The vestiges of the regime continue their attempts to control vital and sovereign ministries. They play games of switching faces rather than changing policies and have retained Ahmad Shafiq despite his well-known loyalty to Mubarak throughout his rule (as Air Force Commander, then minister, then Prime Minister). However, the malignant tumor is resisting its removal, which is also clear in amending a few articles of the ragged constitution while deliberately leaving the absolute powers awarded to the president untouched.,The revolution has overthrown the regime, the government, and the constitution, so in accordance with the current constitution, the head of the People’s Council or the President of the Constitutional Court should have taken Mubarak’s place, not the Military Council. Therefore, the members of the Military Council themselves are the ones who, in reality, did not abide by the constitution. However, the Military Council’s insistence upon keeping the government and constitution and simply refurbishing them is an attempt to thwart the revolution and steer it away from reaching its goals, allowing the malignant sickness its attack. Therefore, let us work to:,,Page 3,The Revolution in the Face of Media Deception,The ruling regime is leading a campaign of media deception in which they constantly repeat the need to give the government another chance. They justify this by saying that the changing conditions of the country demand more time, but the truth of the matter is that this regime really wants more time so that it can gather its power once again. Its leaders want to build up the police force to the point that they can squash any movements or demonstrations which attempt to change the situation of the country in order to benefit the poor and the working class in Egypt. If this were to happen, they would not be able to continue stealing from the daily bread of the people.,The government press and the independent press reiterate that a continuation in the protests, sit-ins, and strikes is harming the economy of the country. However, the fact is these media sources remained silent for dozens of years about the destruction of Egyptian manufacturing. Moreover, they keep spreading propaganda about privatization and the sale of the public sector, that which destroyed the Egyptian economy and added millions to the unemployment lines.,In this way media’s tools of deception repeat that laborers and day workers are suffering from the current standstill and that they cannot find daily subsistence due to the sit-in at Tahrir. The truth, however, is that this talk is biased and misguided. The proof of this is that those who propagate these ideas have at no point ever been interested in day laborers or their circumstances or how to solve their problems in a radical way. No, most of these people promote the policies of the regime, the same policies that led to millions being unemployed or working marginal or unproductive jobs.,The crudest media campaign of deception is that in which it calls for the pardon of police officers. The excuse of this campaign is that policemen must return to the streets so that they may ensure safety and the idea that there are many respectable people in the police force. Meanwhile, we all know the truth. The police force has not ensured our safety for even one day. We know this from the spread of gangsters in our society; most of the police leaders are basically gangsters. Furthermore, members of the police themselves were extorting citizens to invent phantom issues in order to pilfer money.,Any talk about the necessity of pardoning the police force which routinely tortured, killed, and fabricated accusations for too many years, without first discussing the need to clean-up the police force first, is an attempt at returning the police to the streets so they can quash the protests, the demonstrations, and the strikes which are exerting pressure on the ruling elite. These groups are forcing concessions in favor of these popular movements.,Whoever yearns for the future of this country and the future of its children must support continuing the revolution by all peaceful and lawful means: protests, sit-ins, and strikes. This is the only option for us, the poor of this country, to pressure the ruling elite who monopolize the bounty of this country. They give us nothing but crumbs. These elite control the forces of oppression in the police and the army. They use these forces in order to remain in control of the country. These are the very things which mean the maintenance of policies spreading poverty and corruption, policies of following the United States and Israel and being their puppet.,The Students of “Revolutionary” Egypt,We are just about to start a new semester; what remains of Mubarak’s regime is trying to delay it as much as possible primarily out of fear of a student movement since the university is considered a microcosm of the larger society which reflects all of its social classes. There are the “Bashas” (the presidents of the universities, the deans of the colleges, the executives, the leaders of the campus security, and the officers of the national security forces), and the milled (the faculty and staff of the university), and the “Efendis” of the university, they are the ones who really turned the economic policies of Mubarak’s theiving regime against the milled. The majority of them—students and professors—are forced into working in addition to studying so that they can afford their daily bread in a regime which works to augment the wealth of businessmen, executives, and officers while the poor get poorer and more helpless.,Those who remain from Mubarak’s regime and the businessmen are terrified that the students might possibly act as the link between the university professor’s struggle and the struggle of the university workers and staff. This would lead to everyone, inside the walls of the university and outside them, coming together in a clear fashion under the primary slogan of the revolution: “Change, Freedom, and Social Justice.” It is a movement like this one that university administrations are not capable of comprehending. They will collapse one after another, making room for changing university life in Egypt for the better.,High-school students have also repeatedly played an important role in the history of Egyptian student movements and in the revolution. They continue the struggle which began with their demands for improving curricula and teaching, and they will not stop at the demand for the return of the college-affiliation program once again. Affiliated students themselves are struggling for the sake of the affiliation system’s return, the lowering of tuition to its legal level, and for restarting their lectures which the university administrations cancelled last year due to concerns about bird flu. The open-education students have begun organizing during the past weeks and have organized sit-ins putting pressure on the administration after their unsuccessful attempt at stripping the students of their rights. Auditors are affected, just like other students, from the rising costs of books and tuition, the awful state of lecture rooms, facilities and educational media, etc. All of us endure the infiltration of the security forces and their control over student unions, the appointment of teaching assistants, the deans of the colleges, and the president of the university.,All of us dream of an emancipated university, free education, subsidized books, respectable student housing with reasonable costs, and real health insurance which covers students, staff, workers, faculty of the various educational organizations (regular education, affiliated education, open education, distinguished education, etc.). We dream of a university in which we can carry out political, cultural, and artistic activities without intervention from the administration or from the systems of oppression. We dream of a university in which we elect the student union by democratic means without fraud, annulments, or restrictions so that this union will be able to speak for students and express their problems and suggestions in a true fashion… We dream and we have been dreaming for years. Before us is an opportunity for turning our dreams into realities as a part of this grand revolution. We will only be able to exploit this opportunity by tying our demands as students to the demands of teachers, faculty, and staff and creating a link between all of our demands and the principle motto of this revolution (change, freedom, and social equality). We can do this by forming committees to defend the revolution in universities which include everyone who agrees with the revolution’s slogan to struggle equally for the sake of an emancipated university and an emancipated Egypt.,The Demands of Workers in the Revolution,Heroes of the 25th of January Revolution! We are the workers and union members, who have gathered from various worksites that, both before the revolution and now, embark upon strikes, sit-ins, and demonstrations. Hundreds of thousands of workers have participated in them from the various regions of Egypt. We saw fit to unify the demands of the striking workers everywhere so that they will become an integral part of our revolution which was made by the Egyptian people. Our demands are:,Page 4,[Graphic text:] One Hand,The People and the People, One Hand,,By the time we gathered in Tahrir Square and the rest of Egypt’s governorates on Friday, March 4th, 2011, about five weeks had passed since the outbreak of the January 25th Revolution. Those weeks have witnessed the unparalleled heroism of the sons and daughters of the Egyptian people in responding to one of the most violent security apparatuses in the region and perhaps the world. The Egyptians held fast against the blockade, beatings, bullets, and even attacks on camel-back and with clubs. There were wounded in the thousands and martyrs by the hundreds, the missing and arrested in uncountable numbers, for the sake of freedom and a dignified life. They stood steadfastly against all attempts to break them up and repress them. From here, we understand the moments of hope that the army will stand beside the people—in comparison to the tyranny of the Interior Ministry’s men who did not leave the square for one day. No sooner had they pulled out while wearing their official uniforms than they went back in civilian clothes, supported by armies of thugs to spread terror and panic among the citizens, hoping that the people would demand a return of the official police. But that did not happen. Likewise, it was understood from the chants of the demonstrators that the army and the people are one hand, merely for the fact that the tanks did not shell the demonstrators in Tahrir Square. However, we must not forget who it was that opened up the way for the thugs and undercover policemen in civilian clothes to beat the demonstrators on that Black Wednesday—the Army! Who arrested a number of youths, blindfolded them, and detained them in Military Prison, beating them with billy-clubs and electric shock? It was the army. Who attacked those peacefully sitting-in this past Friday night in Tahrir Square, striking them with stun guns and electric batons, arresting some of them under the claim that they were thugs? It was the army. Who tries those arrested in military tribunals and gives sentences ranging between two and five years with no defense? Who threatens the legally protesting workers, considering them instigators of chaos? Who could free all the political prisoners and has not done so? Who could protect the popular neighborhoods, in particular, and has not done so? It is the army.,,On the other hand, only we can remember how it was the people who were the guardians of the revolution during the eighteen days when the revolution was in its initial peak. The people are the ones who protected the square from Security’s secret thugs. The people protected each other (Muslims the Copts and Copts the Muslims) while they each observed prayers. The people’s young men and women sat-in night and day in one place without one incident of harassment. The people were clear in their demand for the fall of the regime… all figureheads of the regime, not just its head, represented by Mubarak. The people immediately noticed that the replacement of Ahmad Nazif with Ahmad Shafiq and the appointment of ‘Umar Sulayman—butcher of torture and head of the Intelligence Services—was nothing but an attempt by the regime to continue with other faces. Mubarak’s speech had not yet ended when the people chanted, “Not Shafiq and not Sulayman!” This people is the only thing guaranteeing the completion of the revolution until its victory is achieved. This people, not the Military Council, the Committee of Wise Men, nor those speaking for the people without authorization, are the only authority of the revolution. This people owns the revolution, and they will decide its path and its demands. They will maintain its continuation, choose its allies, found committees for its defense in the neighborhoods and other places, and respond to the counter-revolution. When the time comes, they will choose those who will speak for them.,,The Popular Committees… Guaranteeing the Defense of the Revolution,,Following the revolution’s success in overthrowing Mubarak and achieving the first of its demands, attempts to abort it have appeared, allied with the counter-revolution that is made up of Shafiq’s government, that of the governors, the National Party’s figureheads, the corrupt businessmen, the leaders of state media, and stakeholders in the former regime. Therefore, we are called to organize ourselves in Popular Committees for the Defense and Protection of the Revolution until the rest of its goals are completed.,What are the Popular Committees?,Citizens began forming the Committees themselves in neighborhoods, unions, factories, companies, and universities to gather together men, women, youths, and activists of different ages and stripes. In most of the governorates, the desire to complete the revolution brought them together in order to establish a just and democratic state. The role of the Committees is focused on three primary areas:,* Public awareness: through exposing the malicious goals of the counter-revolution’s media and presenting a substitute media calling for the people to be united until the revolution is victorious. There are a number of ways to help awareness, such as: statements, publications, popular conferences in the neighborhoods to honor the martyrs and the wounded, exhibitions, cultural and artistic symposiums, etc.,[Logo:] The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,* Oversight: the Committees work to oversee the local apparatuses, the police, companies’ administrations, factories, and universities in order to ensure their commitment to the goals of the revolution as far as eliminating despotism and corruption. Committees have been formed to oversee prices and trade as well as creating blacklists of the corrupt in each neighborhood, supported by documents to bring them to court (such as a corrupt member of the People’s Assembly/Local Council or a murderous or tyrannical police officer).,* Coordination: cooperation and information and knowledge exchange among the Committees is of particular importance along with retaining the confidentiality of each Committee. A number of Committees can cooperate in holding a joint conference so that it will be stronger and more organized. An election of members from each Committee for coordination with the rest of the Committees will be completed.,Voting done in the Committees shall resemble a democracy, as will the division of members into working groups, such as the publication editing group, conference preparation, coordination with other Committees, and following-up with families of the martyrs and wounded…,Will we help you to form or join a Popular Committee?,The newspaper Misr al-Thawriyya [Revolutionary Egypt] calls for every honorable Egyptian to participate in the Committees or form a new one in each area. It offers support and information on its Facebook page “al-Ligan al-Sha’biyya li-l-Difa’ ‘an al-Thawra al-Misriyya” [“The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Egyptian Revolution”] or the pages of the Committees in the neighborhoods on the same site.,To Contact Us and Give Your Suggestions,E-mail: [redacted] – Telephone: [phone # redacted],","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144817im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID289,
"Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 3",2011-07-04,2011,"Page 1,Logo: “The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution”,Revolutionary Egypt,A progressive publication issued by the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.,3rd Edition, 2nd Week of March, 2011,No to Constitutional Amendments… No to Patching up the Constitution,Next March 19th has been set as the date for the referendum on the prospective constitutional amendments. Their proposed form is under a dark shadow of doubt regarding their faithful response to the demand of the revolution and conviction that Egypt shall not return to the past. The form suggested for these amendments indicates nothing but the continuation of a lack of respect for the mentality of the Egyptian citizen and a lack of interest for his participation in the public affairs of his country. When all the revolutionaries demanded change of the Constitution, their demand was clear and specific—namely, that the fall of the regime does not occur with the fall of just its people but with the fall of the Constitution as well. This is the Constitution which the deposed President published. He tailored its laws through tinkering and modification until he became a god through constitutional authority. He had around 88% of the powers granted to the different state authorities. Is it rational to undertake amending it by the same ridiculously laughable logic? As an example, the suggested form of the amended Article 75 forbids Egyptians married to foreigners from candidacy for the Presidency of the Republic despite the presence of a ruling of the Constitutional Court that this is a private matter of citizens—one that does not require denying them one of their rights. It does not address anything with regard to providing opportunities for Egyptians abroad to cast their votes—those whom the deposed President’s regime exiled and displaced so that they left the country in order to not die of hunger and poverty. The deposed regime excluded them from any type of participation in public life, although the majority of the world’s communities exercise their rights to participate in elections and referendums as if they were in their own countries—not expatriates—by balloting at their own embassies. The Committee for Constitutional Amendments seeks to assure us that it will produce the same the corrupt system which the Egyptians overthrew a few weeks ago since the suggested form for Article 76 repeats the same suspicious requirements of the original text. It gives the oversight committee for the upcoming presidential elections the same absolute powers that were previously granted to it. So, it this reasonable? Add to that the fact that we now know that the members presumed to be on this committee were previously appointed by the deposed President. This means that they were part of his regime, his men, even if the committee has judicial approval. However, each one of them—the head of the Constitutional Court, his deputy, the head of the State Council, the head of the Court of Cassation, and the head of the Cairo Court of Exception—all of them were appointed by the deposed President, Hosni Mubarak. Now they’re asking us to put our faith in this committee? The suggested amendment for Article 148, regarding the imposition of the Emergency Law, is defective and loose since the text has categorically stated the impermissibility of extending the state of emergency for a period of more than six months without having a popular referendum. Still, what about imposing the state of emergency for six months and after it ends imposing it once again for six months and so on?? We note that the suggested form theoretically permits this since the text discusses the extent of the state of emergency and not its re-imposition or imposing it once again. Even worse than that is the fact that the referendum will be held on all of the suggested Articles at once, amending them as a single unit, such that one must agree with or refuse all of them as a group. This is contradictory to even the minimum limits of democracy. Did our children give up their souls as ransom for this country only so that the Military Council could come to impose whatever its leaders want on us rather than what the people want??,[Graphic: No to the constitutional amendments, yes to a new Constitution. The Egyptian Revolution is everlasting. We will not back down after today.],The people did not demand amending the constitution but changing it, because the 1971 Constitution lost its legitimacy when Mubarak lost his legitimacy. It is necessary that there be a new Constitution, coming out of revolutionary legitimacy and not from the Military Council or the Constitutional Drafting Committee which the people did not elect. Rather, it has been imposed upon them by the Council.,This referendum scheduled to be done on the 19th of March is nothing but another attempt to abort the revolution and circumvent its demands. Therefore, the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution call for voting against these suspicious amendments and demands a new Constitution for the country.,,The Popular Committees… with the Revolution and against Thuggery,The idea for the Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution came out of Tahrir Square, where it became clear that there were grave threats trying to abort the principle goal of the revolution, “the people want the fall of the regime.” The first of these threats is the reduction of the revolution to overthrowing some of the leaders of corruption along with the rest of the regime and its policies. The second is in the propaganda hostile to the revolution. Some sections of the Egyptian people are trying to make gains in the interests of the ideas of passivity and patience, the idea that change will be gradually achieved, that we must put our faith in those holding the reins of governance right now. These threats motivated a number of those participating in the Tahrir sit-in to think about organizing themselves in their neighborhoods, intending to complete the revolution, actualize the fall of the corrupt regime, and build a new one based on “freedom, dignity, and social justice.”,Many committees have already been formed in a number of neighborhoods and become active in a raising political awareness by distributing statements and holding public conferences in the streets. The committees succeeded in bringing together a large number of politically conscious families to work together both within these neighborhoods and outside of them. This is happening because the success of the revolution is dependent upon the ability of the people to organize themselves against the corrupt political regime which was governing us and still controls many of the state’s institutions. Additionally, it is managing a propaganda campaign against the revolution, and it is not unlikely that it will have a role in igniting sectarian tension in order to abort the revolution. From here comes the importance of the Committees as popular, not party, organizations aiming to complete the revolution.,The Committees are currently active in the field of outreach due to the seriousness of the constitutional amendments. As can be expected, the political activity has a relationship with subsequent political development, especially with changing the Constitution and presidential and parliamentary elections. These developments demand intensified activity as far as political outreach within the popular neighborhoods because there are real dangers that the businessmen and remnants of the National Party will succeed in entering the houses of Parliament once again by buying votes and providing services.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution aim for the self-organization of neighborhood families to undertake popular oversight of the localities, neighborhoods, governorates, and police stations in order to pressure these institutions to be in the service of the people and not continue the policies of authoritarianism, corruption, and neglect. This oversight can be achieved in various ways, such as collecting signatures, demonstrating, and protesting in front of the headquarters of these institutions. Should the Committees succeed in popular oversight, it will be an obstacle against the continuation of corruption. Additionally, through struggling in these Committees, people from among the sons of the neighborhoods will come forth to be qualified so that they can run as candidates for seats in the elected Local Councils.,The Popular Committees can play important roles in preserving security in case of the continued mutiny of the police force, which refuses to return to the streets under various pretexts. They intend to create a climate of panic thanks to the thuggery which the regime created over the decades. In the future, it is possible for the committees to play other important roles in building the political and social regimes more justly, based on the idea of “bottom-up democracy.”,,Page 2,The Presidential Council,The Way to Democratic Transition,The military council is insisting on following steps to transfer power in accordance with a fixed plan and a limited period of time even as the voices of many are demanding a review of these steps, just as the council is insisting on adhering to the constituent assembly’s mandate to amend only certain articles of the constitution, willfully ignoring the demands of the revolution.,Likewise, the council is being hasty in its call for a public referendum on all of the articles of constitution at one time. Rather than [holding a referendum] for each individual article, despite the presence of a number of objections to some of the amendments and despite the fact that the absolute power of the President of the Republic is not curtailed, allowing for the creation of a Pharaoh anew.,And the question is not just how it is possible to call for a referendum in light of the current state of instability, but also how it is possible to do so in light of what appears to be a complete refusal from those of all different persuasions of the military council’s plan and the situation that it has forced upon us. That is, putting the constitutional amendments to a yes-no vote in the referendum on the 19th of March, followed by Parliamentary elections, followed directly by the election of president. This is in order to call upon the new president to form an assembly from the Parliamentarians to draft the constitution, and then to put the constitution to a popular referendum. All of the steps outlined above are going to take place in six months so that the army can return to its barracks.,The powers of the revolution confirm the danger of the scenario the military has envisioned for the transitional period for a number of reasons. Among them is that the Mubarak-era constitution fell for all intents and purposes after the revolution, when Mubarak turned over power to the military council. This is a historical opportunity to draw on the revolutionary legitimacy to create a new constitution that pushes political life and the rights of the citizens to the forefront and creates some sort of balance between the powers of the president, the administration,Parliament and the Judiciary.,The current measures for the new Parliamentary elections protect the same forces and parties from an obsolete era in Parliament. In light of the Muslim Brotherhood’s promise―which is widely doubted―of their aspirations for only a third of Parliamentary seats, we expect that capital and the idea of the servile role of the representative―not his political role―will be utilized in the interest of preserving the remnants of the National Democratic Party or the cartoonish opposition parties, who are professionals regarding elections.,Just as the absence of opportunity for the presidential candidates from the forces of the revolution will push forward faces from the previous regime (like Amr Moussa).,This means that the military council will likely lead to the convolution of the revolution and the gradual hijacking and draining of its goals.,And so we stand together for an alternative path for the revolution:,Creating a temporary presidential council composed of judges or figures chosen by national agreement or elections, to head the transitional period for a period of one year; who will not be permitted to run during the presidential elections immediately following (and who will be civilian, or only partially military), in order to allow the military to return to their barracks,A temporary constitutional proclamation that encompasses the general constitutional principles,Election of a constituent assembly to implement a new constitution,Running of presidential elections, followed by parliamentary elections after one year in order to allow the revolutionary powers to assemble, the public to become aware of the goals of the revolution, and for the defeat of the counter-revolution, which is seeking to harm the nation, so that the Parliament will have patriotic elements representing the people and leading to change,In this way, the Presidential council will realize a peaceful transition to civilian power, just as the transitional period will allow for a society-wide conversation about the new republican system (whether it be parliamentary or presidential) and whether we will be satisfied with only the Sha’b Council as a legislative power, or whether the Shura Council has a real role to play as well, as well as the discussion of many important constitutional issues.,If the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces insists on holding the referendum on March 19, we must go to the polls and vote “No” without any additional comments so that the votes are not discarded, and then continue to work towards realizing the goals of the revolution.,The Emergency Laws…We will break them with hammers,Since the former dictator assumed the position of President of the Republic, Mubarak did not abandon, even for a day, the Emergency Laws by which he snuffed out any political activity that opposed his tyranny. During the past ten years, it was clear that the dictator was using the laws to insure the succession of his son to the presidency without any opposition.,It is known that emergency laws are not invoked except under particular circumstances, such as the outbreak of war, the occurrence of a public crisis or the spread of an epidemic. Egypt is not witnessing any of these issues today, so what justifies the continuance of these laws to this day even after Mubarak, who could not live for even a minute without these laws, was toppled?,When we look at the thirty years during which the state of emergency was enforced, we find that the Emergency Laws were not used even once in the pursuit of those who were corrupt or for punishing those who stole the people’s money. On the contrary, because of these laws, the dictator kept more than 30,000 of those who opposed him in detention centers and internal cells, at a time when the governmental media and the men close to Mubarak were describing his era as “The Brightest Age of Democracy.”,Mubarak used the Emergency Laws not only against the Opposition, but also in order to terrorize every citizen so that they would not dare to demand their right to a better society in which they could live humanely and speak their mind to those in power. e Emergency Laws gave the Ministry of the Interior extra powers in order to suppress the people. In this way, it became natural, in accordance with these laws, for citizens to be stopped and arrested without any charges.,In spite of this, the media is still promoting the false idea that we are in dire need of such laws. Regarding the news agencies that linger on the armed thugs in some of the streets of Cairo, those thugs were, in short, raised up by the Ministry of the Interior and its men. It is the Ministry of the Interior that holds the reins of those who terrorized the revolutionaries, to justify extending the Emergency Laws until this day. The men from the Ministry of the Interior desire to subjugate the people.,After this the people got their revenge on the men of the Interior, who got their just deserts for what they inflicted upon our rights. That is, torture, repression, and terrorism.,For the people toppled the dictator Mubarak and threw him into the trash, we must also throw his laws, which repressed us for thirty long years, into the trash. We must also remember that the revolutionaries do not thrive except through revolution, just as repression does not thrive except through special laws. Such was Mubarak thriving before. The revolutionaries have the legitimacy of the revolution, whereas repression has the Emergency Laws.,The toppling of the Emergency Laws was among those demands of the Revolution that we cannot let go or neglect, for this will never be a democracy without toppling of these laws. They are choking political life in Egypt. There can be no talk of a democratic transformation while these laws, which protect the power of the Ministry of the Interior, stand against the people.,State Security..Not Reconciliation,The January 25 Revolution arrived with a quiver filled with a bunch of demands, one of which has been realized: the fall of the main figure of the previous regime, the deposed President Mubarak. But the revolutionaries continue to struggle for the sake of the realization of all of their demands, none of which they will concede. Foremost among these demands is the dissolution of the State , the tool of repression used by the previous regime, after it changed from an apparatus whose duty was the protection of the nation’s security and its citizens to an apparatus whose duty was to protect the president’s security, his entourage and his corrupt inheritor. This terrifying and corrupt apparatus affected not only political life in Egypt, rather, we could say, without exaggeration, that it ruined everything, for the hands of State Security stretched to all Egyptians, and interfered in everything from getting jobs to campaigning for high positions in the state.,The domination of the State Security apparatus reached to everything great and small in Egypt, and affected much more than public action or the censorship of parties and newspapers, and the active resistance of certain political groups in the street. It dominated even economic and fiscal decisions and interfered in the affairs of universities and schools, and mosques and churches, and used the most filthy means to listen in on conversations and rig elections and fabricate issues for the opposition, and demanded money in exchange for protection from even such places as medical centers.,Until State Security’s headquarters was toppled at the hands of the revolutionaries, the apparatus continued its dirty doings, trying to undermine and destroy the revolution. They started by planting rumors that tried, among other things, to spark terror and fear among citizens using the catchphrase “lawlessness.” They supported this claim by organizing bands of thugs and sending them out in a coordinated and organized fashion to all the cities of Egypt, trying to reignite the conflict between Christians and Muslims by fabricating sectarian incidents. Finally, they burned security headquarters and destroyed documents that implicated figures from the previous regime and those who work in State Security. They left some unimportant documents because they contained only information previously known, or because they would turn public opinion against some religious and media figures, in order to cover up the most important crime, which was destroying important documents in a failed attempt to escape accountability, and subsequent punishment.,And after all of this, there are still this who ask “Dissolution or restructuring?,” to which we reply: How can those who are accustomed to criminality, tyranny and ruling the people with threats and torture announce their repentance now? How can we believe this now and feel safe? This apparatus has a black and terrible history filled ,the rights of those who were held in secret prisons and left, forgotten, for years? How can we agree to restructuring the instigator of sectarian conflict and the destroyer of facilities?,Dissolving the State Security Apparatus completely and trying all the elements whose involvement in crimes is proven is the right of the nation and its citizens, and laying off those who worked in this apparatus and re-employing them in non-authoritarian positions is among the demands that the revolution will not give up. The civilian state for which we are struggling cannot exist in the shadow of this putrid apparatus. We will not be fooled by a mere restructuring or swapping of titles. Dissolution and dissolution only is the demand of all the revolutionaries.,,Page 3,,The National Party …“the Devil’s Head” Has Fallen but out of it Emerged a Swarm of Detestable Insects,Throughout the past sixty years – not only the last thirty years under Mubarak’s rule – there were always people who acted in their own personal interests in order to enter into relationships with whomever was in power. They monopolized popular representation, not in order to serve the people, but rather to create a direct connection that would them to take advantage of this link to the authority that, from their point of view, owned everything in this country. Of course it was not strange that “wealth” was the main factor in this alliance. The head of the regime needed those who were always able to finance secret, underhanded operations, the latest—and not necessarily most painful–of these being the Battle of the Camels in Tahrir Square.,We caution and say… those who have tasted the “satanic recipe” for an alliance of wealth, tribalism, and power are still among us. They created a “gang” that they cannot easily abandon, even though the creation of a completely new regime most certainly means opening all the old dossiers and stopping the majority of the projects through which they earned suspicious profits. They still have positions of power and lists of voters’ names, as well as memberships in the local councils, which gives you an idea of their forceful desire to permeate the Egyptian streets yet again in a new way.,The men of the National Party have not stopped “thinking” about “wealth” as an effective medium of influence, not by directly buying votes in front of the voting booths, but rather by trying to lead “the counter-revolution” and “steal all the achievements of the revolution.” For example, we find them announcing the formation of new political parties and bonds with the provinces, projects primarily focused on providing imaginary opportunities for work and housing. They announce that they have opened communication with governors, asking them to provide aid for the families of those who were martyred or wounded in the revolution, who exerted all their energy throughout the eighteen days it took to bring the system down. These men from the National Party are still trying; they organize visits to impoverished popular neighborhoods, jamming up doorsteps with the sheets of their failures, presenting them with nothing but shame and insults.,The picture might be clear to those who understand the reasons and aspirations of this genuinely popular revolution. It is clear to those who understand the role of “the Parliament” in monitoring the regime, offering laws which bring the citizens’ hopes and their attempts to live honorably to fruition. But this “clear picture” still requires a great amount of “revolutionary” effort. It requires that we use all possible means of pressure to blockade this “criminal entity” called the National Party, which for the past thirty years has sullied its hands with the blood of Egyptians through death, decline, dukedom, increased poverty rates, and so on, while their own pockets swelled. There must be a clear demand for the complete dissolution of the National Party, legal prosecution for everyone involved with it, and the “reintegration” of its members into society on several conditions, the first of which being their “accounting” for all their former actions and “careful examination” of all their future ones.,What is the Revolution?? What is the Regime??,Beginning on January 25th, the Egyptian masses were stirred awake to announce their revolution against the regime and the people’s desire for its downfall. They succeeded in overthrowing the head of the regime by deposing President Mubarak. Likewise, Ahmad Shafiq’s government fell, and they have now entered their battle against the security apparatus. We do not have to detract from those great achievements, just as we should not be misled by the talk of those say that the regime fell completely merely due to Mubarak’s removal along with some of the regime’s symbols. However, we do need to understand what the regime was and what its role and nature was. The regime is not an unbiased entity, but rather the result of an incompatibility of the interests of the rulers and the ruled. The regime was created in order to impose the authority and interests of the ruling class over the suffering masses, the sons of this people. It is an instrument which allows those who hold the power and wealth to exploit the masses. If we look at the essence of this regime, it consisted of the armed apparatus—the police, State Security, and Central Security, in addition to the army. That whole apparatus was designed to deprive the people of their freedom and to protect only the regime. If we now were to take a look at the situation in Egypt, we would see the regime as it really is. Despite the fact that it sacrificed some of its figureheads, here it is trying to use all of its forces, ferociously, to protect its interests. These victories which we have realized are nothing but concessions that it was forced to make under the pressure of the masses.,Regarding revolution, it does not mean exchanging one ruler with another. Instead, it means a total and complete change in which the former regime is demolished and a substitute emerges from it in harmony with the revolution’s principles. In this case, the regime changes and the ruling authority is replaced by an authority which expresses the public. A change in the distribution of wealth also occurs. In the light of the revolution, the remains of the ruling authority are fighting desperately to keep their power. Even if its repressive apparatus failed in its self-protection, they will try to use the media to spread their opinions. We see the old ruling class trying to convince the masses that the regime fell with Mubarak when he fell. However, this is not true, and the regime is trying once again to convince the masses that it is not possible to change again—as if the authority of this class is unending and as if it would not be possible to change the regime. The counter-revolution promotes these lies to protect the interests of its own class. In reality, the revolution does not happen simply because the majority changed their minds overnight. Rather, these thoughts changed on the level of the masses by way of their struggle. The thoughts changed during the struggle when the masses realized their ability to enact change. They also realized that the toiling classes, ground to bits, had a shared interest in facing off against their leaders. They also realized that the differences the ruling class tried to use to split them do not have any importance. There is no difference between women and men or Muslims and Christians. As an example of this, every day we see attempts to incite sectarian riots in Egypt, such as what happened in the ‘Atfih Church. These must be overcome. Once again, this ruling class is trying to create a security panic amongst the crowds of the masses in order to impose their authority—as if we could not live without them and their apparatus. However, the experience proved that we do not need to use this repressive apparatus to secure our neighborhoods. The role of that apparatus is to protect the ruling minority and to repress the masses. As far as the security of the neighborhoods and the organization of the traffic movement are concerned, we can create more democratic and efficient instruments, able to deal with these matters in a better way. The revolution is not an event that happens on a specific day but is a process of change. If we now want to continue our revolution in order to realize the goals we have not yet achieved, then we have to organize ourselves to face off against the organized enemies of the revolution, the old regime. Our martyrs who gave their lives during the revolution did not do so in order that another ruler could take Mubarak’s place nor to paint the sidewalks. They gave their lives for real change in society—a society with real freedom, free of any kind of repression and oppression, in which wealth is redistributed in order to realize social justice.,Humanities Teaching Assistants of ‘Ayn Shams against University Corruption,Believe us—we, the young members of the teaching staff at the College of the Arts at ‘Ayn Shams University—the corrupt regime we brought down was not only one individual; its corruption spread to every entity in the Egyptian nation, reaching even as far as the country’s educational activities, which are based on preserving the freedom of this nation, given that we are an institution whose studies express the nation’s conscience. We have decided to play the reformatory role that our consciences and fear for Egypt require of us, for our Egypt has long suffered as corrupt officials and dictators overpowered its people’s wishes. We will begin our reforms by standing against any exploitative elements who try to taint our college’s message, or who aim to destroy our enlightened and educational project or our sacred academy. This project will be undertaken through a group of demands which we will exert great effort to implement, whatever the sacrifices required.,We welcome everyone who wishes to work with us toward the amelioration of the current situation, especially tutors, teachers, assistants, and students. They have the priority since they are the core and the root of respectable academic existence. We are prepared to engage with all intellectual and political movements on the condition that we stand unified in support of reform and repair, without the imposition of dominance or guardianship.,,Members of the Humanities Staff at ‘Ayn Shams,Page 4,Muslim and Copt Hand in Hand..For the Sake of the New Beginning We Are Creating,[Figure text: Stand with the revolution against sectarianism!],A few days ago, the revolutionaries were able to teach State Security a new and unforgettable lesson when they stormed its special headquarters in Nasr City, Shubra and Alexandria, as well as in many other provinces. However, it is clear that this repressive apparatus did not take notice, for today it is plotting its revenge on the revolutionaries and the abortion of their revolution using the most dangerous weapon it possesses..the weapon of sectarian strife.,It is not the first time that the dogs in the Ministry of the Interior have used this weapon. In fact, strife was one of the traditional means used to divide the populace, Muslims and Christians, in the era of the dictator Mubarak. We can only remember how central intelligence forces hit Christians and destroyed Al-’Amrania Church before the Parliamentary elections last November, which coincided with a wave of hysteria to attack the Copts in the government-funded media. The goal of this was as clear as daylight, for the regime did not want Muslim unity. Additionally, the recent burning of the church in Atfiah, and the murderous actions that occurred against Copts in Manshi’at Nasr, are aiming only to split the ranks of the revolutionaries into Christians and Muslims. It is not possible that what is being stated here is only a slur or allegation against the Ministry of the Interior, for it is the Ministry that planned the bombing of the Qadisin Church and that tried to destroy Al-’Amrania Church, etc.,The police made clear their true intentions as soon as they descended into the street. They want to get revenge on citizens and to make the revolutionaries kneel before them. This was apparent in the position of the Director of Security in al-Buhayra, and then in the crime at Damanhur prison, and before that at the al-Ma’adi driver incident.,All of this, combined with what we see and hear about the activities of informants and those instigating rumors, whom the Ministry of the Interior assembled rumors against the revolution, and the harassment of peaceful protesters.,Today the revolution faces danger. The Ministry of the Interior is using the filthiest means possible to ignite sectarian strife and split the ranks of the revolutionaries. On the other hand, the revolutionaries rebelled against injustice, tyranny, and poverty, gave their lives, and faced down live fire and thugs, standing shoulder to shoulder. They have remained strong in their sit-ins and strikes, protecting each other and sharing morsels of food amongst themselves. These revolutionaries will face the efforts of the state and the counter-revolution that the Ministry of the Interior and its agents created, and they will overcome them.,For we have undertaken the revolution with the understanding that the unity of the protesters is the only way to victory. We know that the split between Muslim and Christian was only ever due to the regime and in the interest of its remaining in place and maintaining its [firm] grip and domination..We will not allow them to divide our ranks..Our struggle is continuing..Continuing until the all the criminals of Mubarak’s regime are put on trial..and Egypt is cleansed of them.,To Contact and Give Your Suggestions,E-mail: leganthawrya@yahoo.com – Central Telephone: [phone # redacted],Facebook/ al-Ligan al-Sha‘biyya li-l-Difa‘ ‘an al-Thawra al-Misriyya [The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Egyptian Revolution],The Blog/ Http://leganthawrya.blogspot.com,al-Haram, Faysal, al-‘Amraniyya/ [redacted],Bulaq al-Dakrur/ [redacted],Imbaba/ [redacted],al-Sayyida Zaynab/ [redacted],Shubra/ [redacted],al-Zaytun/ [redacted],al-Nazha al-Gadida/ [redacted],Nasr City/ [redacted],al-Ma‘adi, al-Basatin, and Dar al-Salam/ [redacted],al-Gamaliyya/ [redacted],al-Shaykh Zayid and 6th of October/ [redacted],al-Isma‘iliyya/ [redacted],Alexandria/ [redacted],Al-Fayum/ [redacted],,","Revolution, Revolutionary Newspapers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144820im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/revegyptvol3-e1305543256296.png,imgID290,
Sons of Tahrir … Holding on to the Revolution’s Embers,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 1],Sons of Tahrir … Holding on to the Revolution’s Embers,Those who took to the streets during the 18 days that allowed us to get rid of Mubarak are not the only ones holding onto the revolution’s embers, for there is also,a group of revolutionary young men and women who decided to return to hold sit-ins on Tahrir Square a few days ago. They are asking for the fall of Shafiq’s government, an elected civilian presidential council, and other demands of the revolution which have not yet been met due to a slowdown of their realization and their circumventing by the current power. These young men and women are exposed daily to organized attempts to frighten and terrorize them at the hands of the army, the State Security Investigations Services, and what remains of the National Party. These institutions send hired hands to Tahrir Square, intending to spread rumors and pick fights with these courageous, brave youths.,Despite the stinging cold of winter, these steadfast braves in the square were subjected, night and day, to forceful attempts at dissolving their sit-ins at the hand of the “army” forces. On Friday, the 25th of February, notwithstanding the violence, intimidation, and arrests of some to which they were subjected, they returned to the square the next day, full of enthusiasm and perseverance. With their heads raised they faced off against repression, carrying posters that invited all the Egyptian people to complete their revolution against the not-yet-fallen regime. This regime is trying to keep its figureheads, rebuilding what was before January 25th, trying to cheat us with idle talk like the necessity of “patience” and “giving them a chance”. Yes, they do indeed want a chance. However, it is not an opportunity to realize our demands but rather one to bring back the ranks of Central Security and other forces of oppression. They are doing this so that they will be able to control and destroy the revolution completely.,Every day, our noble people come to Tahrir Square, but so do people who have been “duped” by false propaganda that the regime spreads against those sitting-in and rumors spread by agents of the State Security Investigations Services. They are trying to convince these youths to dissolve their sit-ins, but the youth are truly equipped with the patience and morality of revolutionaries. Our people discuss the necessity of returning to sit-in at Tahrir Square until the demands of the revolution are met and the martyr’s blood, shed by the regime which is still there despite the fall of its head, has been recompensed. They convinced some of our people. They go to their houses, provide them with blankets and tents, and they come to join our revolutionary youth. This way the numbers on Tahrir Square increase every day, as well as the numbers of people convinced of the importance of continuing the battle. These youths are a part of revolutionary Egypt—an Egypt which refuses to return to what was before Januray 25th. Old Egypt is moving forward on the path of justice, freedom, and equality. They actively reflect the saying: “If I would not burn but you would, how should the light ever leave this darkness?”,",Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130144823im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID291,
The Popular Committees… Guaranteeing the Defense of the Revolution,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 4],The Popular Committees… Guaranteeing the Defense of the Revolution,,Following the revolution’s success in overthrowing Mubarak and achieving the first of its demands, attempts to abort it have appeared, allied with the counter-revolution that is made up of Shafiq’s government, that of the governors, the National Party’s figureheads, the corrupt businessmen, the leaders of state media, and stakeholders in the former regime. Therefore, we are called to organize ourselves in Popular Committees for the Defense and Protection of the Revolution until the rest of its goals are completed.,What are the Popular Committees?,Citizens began forming the Committees themselves in neighborhoods, unions, factories, companies, and universities to gather together men, women, youths, and activists of different ages and stripes. In most of the governorates, the desire to complete the revolution brought them together in order to establish a just and democratic state. The role of the Committees is focused on three primary areas:,* Public awareness: through exposing the malicious goals of the counter-revolution’s media and presenting a substitute media calling for the people to be united until the revolution is victorious. There are a number of ways to help awareness, such as: statements, publications, popular conferences in the neighborhoods to honor the martyrs and the wounded, exhibitions, cultural and artistic symposiums, etc.,[Logo:] The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,* Oversight: the Committees work to oversee the local apparatuses, the police, companies’ administrations, factories, and universities in order to ensure their commitment to the goals of the revolution as far as eliminating despotism and corruption. Committees have been formed to oversee prices and trade as well as creating blacklists of the corrupt in each neighborhood, supported by documents to bring them to court (such as a corrupt member of the People’s Assembly/Local Council or a murderous or tyrannical police officer).,* Coordination: cooperation and information and knowledge exchange among the Committees is of particular importance along with retaining the confidentiality of each Committee. A number of Committees can cooperate in holding a joint conference so that it will be stronger and more organized. An election of members from each Committee for coordination with the rest of the Committees will be completed.,Voting done in the Committees shall resemble a democracy, as will the division of members into working groups, such as the publication editing group, conference preparation, coordination with other Committees, and following-up with families of the martyrs and wounded…,Will we help you to form or join a Popular Committee?,The newspaper Misr al-Thawriyya [Revolutionary Egypt] calls for every honorable Egyptian to participate in the Committees or form a new one in each area. It offers support and information on its Facebook page “al-Ligan al-Sha’biyya li-l-Difa’ ‘an al-Thawra al-Misriyya” [“The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Egyptian Revolution”] or the pages of the Committees in the neighborhoods on the same site.,","Politics, The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151606im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID292,
"The People and the People, One Hand",2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 4],[Graphic text:] One Hand,The People and the People, One Hand,By the time we gathered in Tahrir Square and the rest of Egypt’s governorates on Friday, March 4th, 2011, about five weeks had passed since the outbreak of the January 25th Revolution. Those weeks have witnessed the unparalleled heroism of the sons and daughters of the Egyptian people in responding to one of the most violent security apparatuses in the region and perhaps the world. The Egyptians held fast against the blockade, beatings, bullets, and even attacks on camel-back and with clubs. There were wounded in the thousands and martyrs by the hundreds, the missing and arrested in uncountable numbers, for the sake of freedom and a dignified life. They stood steadfastly against all attempts to break them up and repress them. From here, we understand the moments of hope that the army will stand beside the people—in comparison to the tyranny of the Interior Ministry’s men who did not leave the square for one day. No sooner had they pulled out while wearing their official uniforms than they went back in civilian clothes, supported by armies of thugs to spread terror and panic among the citizens, hoping that the people would demand a return of the official police. But that did not happen. Likewise, it was understood from the chants of the demonstrators that the army and the people are one hand, merely for the fact that the tanks did not shell the demonstrators in Tahrir Square. However, we must not forget who it was that opened up the way for the thugs and undercover policemen in civilian clothes to beat the demonstrators on that Black Wednesday—the Army! Who arrested a number of youths, blindfolded them, and detained them in Military Prison, beating them with billy-clubs and electric shock? It was the army. Who attacked those peacefully sitting-in this past Friday night in Tahrir Square, striking them with stun guns and electric batons, arresting some of them under the claim that they were thugs? It was the army. Who tries those arrested in military tribunals and gives sentences ranging between two and five years with no defense? Who threatens the legally protesting workers, considering them instigators of chaos? Who could free all the political prisoners and has not done so? Who could protect the popular neighborhoods, in particular, and has not done so? It is the army.,,On the other hand, only we can remember how it was the people who were the guardians of the revolution during the eighteen days when the revolution was in its initial peak. The people are the ones who protected the square from Security’s secret thugs. The people protected each other (Muslims the Copts and Copts the Muslims) while they each observed prayers. The people’s young men and women sat-in night and day in one place without one incident of harassment. The people were clear in their demand for the fall of the regime… all figureheads of the regime, not just its head, represented by Mubarak. The people immediately noticed that the replacement of Ahmad Nazif with Ahmad Shafiq and the appointment of ‘Umar Sulayman—butcher of torture and head of the Intelligence Services—was nothing but an attempt by the regime to continue with other faces. Mubarak’s speech had not yet ended when the people chanted, “Not Shafiq and not Sulayman!” This people is the only thing guaranteeing the completion of the revolution until its victory is achieved. This people, not the Military Council, the Committee of Wise Men, nor those speaking for the people without authorization, are the only authority of the revolution. This people owns the revolution, and they will decide its path and its demands. They will maintain its continuation, choose its allies, found committees for its defense in the neighborhoods and other places, and respond to the counter-revolution. When the time comes, they will choose those who will speak for them.,","Military, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130164637im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID293,

The Students of “Revolutionary” Egypt,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 3],,The Students of “Revolutionary” Egypt,We are just about to start a new semester; what remains of Mubarak’s regime is trying to delay it as much as possible primarily out of fear of a student movement since the university is considered a microcosm of the larger society which reflects all of its social classes. There are the “Bashas” (the presidents of the universities, the deans of the colleges, the executives, the leaders of the campus security, and the officers of the national security forces), and the milled (the faculty and staff of the university), and the “Efendis” of the university, they are the ones who really turned the economic policies of Mubarak’s theiving regime against the milled. The majority of them—students and professors—are forced into working in addition to studying so that they can afford their daily bread in a regime which works to augment the wealth of businessmen, executives, and officers while the poor get poorer and more helpless.,Those who remain from Mubarak’s regime and the businessmen are terrified that the students might possibly act as the link between the university professor’s struggle and the struggle of the university workers and staff. This would lead to everyone, inside the walls of the university and outside them, coming together in a clear fashion under the primary slogan of the revolution: “Change, Freedom, and Social Justice.” It is a movement like this one that university administrations are not capable of comprehending. They will collapse one after another, making room for changing university life in Egypt for the better.,High-school students have also repeatedly played an important role in the history of Egyptian student movements and in the revolution. They continue the struggle which began with their demands for improving curricula and teaching, and they will not stop at the demand for the return of the college-affiliation program once again. Affiliated students themselves are struggling for the sake of the affiliation system’s return, the lowering of tuition to its legal level, and for restarting their lectures which the university administrations cancelled last year due to concerns about bird flu. The open-education students have begun organizing during the past weeks and have organized sit-ins putting pressure on the administration after their unsuccessful attempt at stripping the students of their rights. Auditors are affected, just like other students, from the rising costs of books and tuition, the awful state of lecture rooms, facilities and educational media, etc. All of us endure the infiltration of the security forces and their control over student unions, the appointment of teaching assistants, the deans of the colleges, and the president of the university.,All of us dream of an emancipated university, free education, subsidized books, respectable student housing with reasonable costs, and real health insurance which covers students, staff, workers, faculty of the various educational organizations (regular education, affiliated education, open education, distinguished education, etc.). We dream of a university in which we can carry out political, cultural, and artistic activities without intervention from the administration or from the systems of oppression. We dream of a university in which we elect the student union by democratic means without fraud, annulments, or restrictions so that this union will be able to speak for students and express their problems and suggestions in a true fashion… We dream and we have been dreaming for years. Before us is an opportunity for turning our dreams into realities as a part of this grand revolution. We will only be able to exploit this opportunity by tying our demands as students to the demands of teachers, faculty, and staff and creating a link between all of our demands and the principle motto of this revolution (change, freedom, and social equality). We can do this by forming committees to defend the revolution in universities which include everyone who agrees with the revolution’s slogan to struggle equally for the sake of an emancipated university and an emancipated Egypt.,","Movements, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130165838im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID295,
The Revolution in the Face of Media Deception,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 3],The Revolution in the Face of Media Deception,The ruling regime is leading a campaign of media deception in which they constantly repeat the need to give the government another chance. They justify this by saying that the changing conditions of the country demand more time, but the truth of the matter is that this regime really wants more time so that it can gather its power once again. Its leaders want to build up the police force to the point that they can squash any movements or demonstrations which attempt to change the situation of the country in order to benefit the poor and the working class in Egypt. If this were to happen, they would not be able to continue stealing from the daily bread of the people.,The government press and the independent press reiterate that a continuation in the protests, sit-ins, and strikes is harming the economy of the country. However, the fact is these media sources remained silent for dozens of years about the destruction of Egyptian manufacturing. Moreover, they keep spreading propaganda about privatization and the sale of the public sector, that which destroyed the Egyptian economy and added millions to the unemployment lines.,In this way media’s tools of deception repeat that laborers and day workers are suffering from the current standstill and that they cannot find daily subsistence due to the sit-in at Tahrir. The truth, however, is that this talk is biased and misguided. The proof of this is that those who propagate these ideas have at no point ever been interested in day laborers or their circumstances or how to solve their problems in a radical way. No, most of these people promote the policies of the regime, the same policies that led to millions being unemployed or working marginal or unproductive jobs.,The crudest media campaign of deception is that in which it calls for the pardon of police officers. The excuse of this campaign is that policemen must return to the streets so that they may ensure safety and the idea that there are many respectable people in the police force. Meanwhile, we all know the truth. The police force has not ensured our safety for even one day. We know this from the spread of gangsters in our society; most of the police leaders are basically gangsters. Furthermore, members of the police themselves were extorting citizens to invent phantom issues in order to pilfer money.,Any talk about the necessity of pardoning the police force which routinely tortured, killed, and fabricated accusations for too many years, without first discussing the need to clean-up the police force first, is an attempt at returning the police to the streets so they can quash the protests, the demonstrations, and the strikes which are exerting pressure on the ruling elite. These groups are forcing concessions in favor of these popular movements.,Whoever yearns for the future of this country and the future of its children must support continuing the revolution by all peaceful and lawful means: protests, sit-ins, and strikes. This is the only option for us, the poor of this country, to pressure the ruling elite who monopolize the bounty of this country. They give us nothing but crumbs. These elite control the forces of oppression in the police and the army. They use these forces in order to remain in control of the country. These are the very things which mean the maintenance of policies spreading poverty and corruption, policies of following the United States and Israel and being their puppet.,",Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160612im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID296,

I told him that for thirty years the regime of corruption has spread in Egypt’s body like a malignant tumor. We are left with no choice but to remove it entirely in order to heal the country. Otherwise, its remaining parts would viciously attack the nation’s body. The more complete its removal, the quicker and more secure the nation’s healing would be.,The vestiges of the regime continue their attempts to control vital and sovereign ministries. They play games of switching faces rather than changing policies and have retained Ahmad Shafiq despite his well-known loyalty to Mubarak throughout his rule (as Air Force Commander, then minister, then Prime Minister). However, the malignant tumor is resisting its removal, which is also clear in amending a few articles of the ragged constitution while deliberately leaving the absolute powers awarded to the president untouched.,The revolution has overthrown the regime, the government, and the constitution, so in accordance with the current constitution, the head of the People’s Council or the President of the Constitutional Court should have taken Mubarak’s place, not the Military Council. Therefore, the members of the Military Council themselves are the ones who, in reality, did not abide by the constitution. However, the Military Council’s insistence upon keeping the government and constitution and simply refurbishing them is an attempt to thwart the revolution and steer it away from reaching its goals, allowing the malignant sickness its attack.

Was the Regime Only Mubarak?,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 2],Was the Regime Only Mubarak?,Oppression, corruption and dictatorship were all important factors in awakening the anger of the Egyptian people and setting off the spark of the revolution. But there was also another reason for the anger. Namely, that the men of this regime were characterized by arrogance, boastfulness and haughtiness, while at the same time the people did not find them at all justified in this hubris.,They treated the people as if they were incompetent, incapable, and totally stupid, therefore deserving of their poverty and humiliation.,The news of the deposed President of the Republic and his family was considered to have priority, no matter how unimportant it was, over the most important Egyptian or world news. Their movements would bring society to a grinding halt, even if only for a journey or short trip to Sharm al-Shaykh.,The government’s newspapers and media addressed members of the opposition with disdain and scorn, neglecting their news completely or referring to it with other names, such as when they referred to the biggest political organization in Egypt as “the prohibited one”.,The fraud in the last elections was obvious, crudely undertaken, and without precedent in the history of elections in Egypt. It reflected apathy and great scorn for the people and their desires. The fraud brought with it a parliament in which the voice of opposition was not represented. So when some opposition figures thought about building a shadow parliament, the President of the Republic commented: “Let them have fun.” This comment demonstrated the extent of his apathy towards the feelings of the people in the face of a sham election. Then came the explosion, and the people’s anger about this degree of arrogance and apathy was definitely among its causes. The people did not find anyone with exceptional intelligence, extraordinary wisdom, or unrivaled skills to administer this country from among these men in charge of the regime: education declined, access to health services for a reasonable price became more and more difficult, unemployment rose, foreign policy did not spring from the national will, and so on.,The question is now: what comes after Mubarak’s dismissal?? Let’s talk a bit about Shafiq’s government. Mubarak substituted a new face from his regime for an old one and placed a minister of the old government as its new president. However, the new Prime Minister, by virtue of his having been a minister for the past six years, is still responsible, along with the rest of the ministers, for the complaints of the people. If he can respond to the people’s wishes now, why did he not make any effort to influence the past government to prevent the anger of the crowds? As far as the rest of the new ministers are concerned, they are nothing but copies of the former ministers. One of them, who was a compliant subordinate of the hated Minister of Culture, happens to be the new Minister of Culture. The former minister insisted on people calling him “The Artistic Minister”. What could it possibly be that the new minister wants people to call him? The Minister of Trade and Manufacturing was the right hand of the former Minister of Trade and Manufacturing. So what kind of change can we expect to occur? The regime as such is determined to deal with the people with the same arrogance and disdain, as though the demonstrators, more than hundreds of whom were young men and women who sacrificed their lives, were demonstrating because they did not have anything else with which to entertain themselves.,Truly the current system consists of a gang controlling Egypt, a league with members everywhere—in every neighbourhood, every city, every county and every governmental agency. The police, arsenal, and weapons of the Interior Ministry are only used to safeguard this gang. The revolution led the gang’s leader to disappear from the picture, but all of its members are still among us. We all have a role in the broad campaign for purification. Disgrace the election-riggers, bring the ones who tortured your sons to trial. Do not be silent about the humiliation again. Only this way will the revolutions join together to defend our revolution.,","Mubarak and Family, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155440im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID298,
No to Military Tribunals,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 2],No to Military Tribunals,,[Picture text: No to Military Tribunals],Rights organizations, in a press release issued on March 2nd, 2011, condemned the ruling of the military tribunal in the case of ‘Amr ‘Abd Allah ‘Abd al-Rasul al-Buhayri (23 years old), carrying #155 of the year 2011’s Military Crimes East. His guilty verdict was announced on the 1st of March, and he was sentenced to prison for five years for the charge of abusing the cost of public service and breaking the curfew following a period of no more than three days after his arrest. The organizations denounced the transfer of civilians to military tribunals—made up of officers belonging to the army—for non-military crimes. These organizations consider this an infraction of the simplest rights of citizens to fair trials. They emphasized that all the international conventions to which Egypt is a party stress adherence to the standards of fair trials, even in times of emergency, and that the state has no right to abandon this commitment.,The organizations expressed their concern about a number of trials that have gone on during the past weeks since the outbreak of the revolution on the 25th of January 2011. Breaching of principles and international standards has marred the revolution, especially as regards fair and public trials. In many cases, the families of those accused have not been able to visit their kin or find legal counsel to defend them. Even if they had the opportunity for legal counsel, the quickness of these trials does not permit a lawyer time to go over the case and prepare an appropriate defense for the accused. Additionally, the secrecy of the trials increases the seriousness of the situation, for in the majority of cases the date of the trial as well as the location of the accuseds’ detention are not made available to their families until after the verdict is announced.,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution view the abolition of trials of civilians before military courts or extraordinary courts as one of the revolution’s demands; we did not demand the repeal of the Emergency Law only to replace it with military tribunals. Both of them are clear signs proving that Mubarak’s regime is not yet finished. Also, they were both among the most prevalent ways to repress the opposition and silence anyone talking about rights in the face of injustice and tyranny.,,","Military, Military Tribunals",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162545im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID299,
Our Revolution Continues Until the Fall of the Regime,2011-07-04,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 2, Page 1],Our Revolution Continues Until the Fall of the Regime,When the angry masses succeeded in overthrowing Mubarak and forcing him to leave power, the Egyptian Revolution was just announcing its beginning. The fall of the head of the corrupt regime meant the start of a long battle to demolish its staff and tear out its roots in society. Thirty years of tyranny and corruption were enough for the regime to stretch its arms out in all directions, and so the fall of its head is no longer enough. Rather, it has become necessary for the revolution to continue in order to remove those arms and complete the cycle of the revolution by tearing down the former regime, and building a new one. It was upon this principle that the people of the rebellion worked toward establishing the revolution’s bases and roots everywhere, and Committees for the Defense of the Revolution popped up in various neighborhoods, cities and provinces. Workers strove to establish unions and committees in labor sites. These roots and missions are no less important than the heroic struggle fought by the masses from January 25th to February 11th to topple Mubarak. For if the Egyptian Revolution leaves the body of the regime in the provinces, cities, and official establishments, it will sprout a thousand new heads, so as to hijack the revolution. The fight of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution against the appearances of corruption in all parts of Egypt is the best way to weed out the roots of corruption, and the formation of committees for the people everywhere is what will prevent the return of tyranny and persecution to Egyptian streets. The struggle of workers for fair wages and to expose corruption in economic companies and institutions is what prevents any chance of return for the old regime. The movements of the farmers, who are raising their demands in the villages and revealing the persecution from which they have suffered, and how it squandered their rights just as it ruined Egypt’s agricultural wealth for the benefit of a handful of wealthy people, this is what gives back hope in our ability to provide sustenance for ourselves.,The message of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution is clear. No longer will anyone treat our rights as if they were handouts to be grateful for. We will not get any more than what we fight for in this movement. The masses who organize themselves in committees today will be the ones who stand tomorrow in front of those in charge. [They will] demand the publication of the ‘social services’ budget for the cities and neighborhoods, demanding that they be monitored by the true representatives of the people, and that utilities and social services be distributed fairly between the upper and lower class neighborhoods. These are the ones who tomorrow will be able to count the unemployed in the neighborhoods and organize them in a union for the unemployed to demand true work opportunities for their youth or unemployment welfare.,The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which are formed today by the fighters of the rebellion, are a continuous reconstruction of the revolution and its goals everywhere in Egypt, and they are a true guarantee for the protection of the revolution against those who try to destroy it.,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162039im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/thawria2.png,imgID300,
The Principles of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party,2011-07-03,2011,"The Principles of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party,The youth revolution of January 25th has turned into a marvelous popular revolution calling for freedom, human dignity, and social justice.

What Do You Know about the Philadelphi Agreement between Egypt and “Israel” against Gaza?,2011-08-22,2011,",What Do You Know about the Philadelphi Agreement between Egypt and “Israel” against Gaza?,,It is an Egyptian-Israeli agreement regarding the border region with Gaza, signed in September 2005 after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, in which the responsibility for securing this border shifted to the Egyptian government. In brief:,,The Egyptian administration itself has been implicated over period of more than 30 years in a series of agreements and commitments which ultimately serve only the security of “Israel” and persist in injuring popular national sentiment. The Philadelphi Agreement was not the first of them, nor will the construction of the steel wall be the last. It will not end unless we succeed in toppling the Camp David option and its approach and in restoring Egypt once again as the leader of Arab struggle.,,Join hands to end the siege of Gaza and reconstruct it,[page2],Come to the aid of Gaza,,The Egyptian-International Coalition for Ending the Blockade and Rebuilding Gaza announces the third visit of the coalition’s delegation to the Gaza Strip for the purpose of providing medical aid. This will take place via the Rafah crossing this coming September.,,This visit comes as an expression of the support of the Egyptian people—who freed themselves from the tyranny of Mubarak—for the Palestinian people, heroic and steadfast before the racist Israeli persecution occupying their homeland. As a complement to the journey of the Egyptian people and their valiant revolution, we believe that Egypt’s foreign policy toward the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip must change, and the blockade must be lifted immediately.,,The Gaza Strip is still in dire need of medical supplies after five years of the criminal blockade and Zionist attacks, which continued day and night for three weeks against the Strip in 2008/2009 and which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 and the wounding of more than 10 thousand unarmed civilians left permanently disabled.,,During the coalition delegation’s meeting with His Excellency the Palestinian Minister of Health Dr. Basim Na`im—during the coalition’s last visit to the Strip on 9/7/2011—he said: “We welcome your delegation, which represents the new Egypt—Egypt which led the nation [al-umma] for many decades to its apex, and which, to great dismay, retreated from its role in recent years. The siege of Gaza was and is a crime against the right of the Palestinian people, a crime shared in by those near and far.”,,He confirmed that what the besieged Strip requires in terms of medicine and medical supplies reaches two and a half million American dollars monthly.,,Dr. Basim Na`im added: Egypt is the Islamic and Arab state that has a direct border with us. Our relationship with it and the ties of blood extend through history. Until the beginning of the nineties, all the Palestinian doctors in Gaza were graduates of Egyptian medical schools. This is what leads it to be scientific authority for them. It is natural that Egypt, the largest Arab state which fought a lot for the Palestinian cause, play this role.,,The coalition delegation met the head of the Palestinian government in Gaza, Dr. Isma`il Haniyya, who saluted this spirit and this initiative, describing it as greatly appreciated by the Palestinian people and the government.,,He said: “I invite this dignified coalition to raise the call (Let’s Open The Rafah Crossing). For victorious Egypt and the victorious revolution cannot continue the policies of the previous regime.”,,Brother Isma`il Haniyya added: “We ask only for the passage of 1500 Palestinians through the Rafah crossing daily, likewise we request permission to bring in building materials as well as humanitarian aid, and to open the crossing to a reasonable capacity. The true crisis now is the Rafah crossing. We hope that this crisis finds a solution. We are counting on the youth of Egypt, who opened a door to the nation [umma] through their revolution. I hope that you will convey my greetings to the Egyptian people, and especially the youth.”,,Ultimately, we in the Egyptian-International Coalition for Ending the Blockade and Rebuilding Gaza see that this visit represents a first step in the direction of freeing trade between Egypt and the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. We demand that legitimate international trade between two brotherly states, in addition to the import of humanitarian aid to the Strip, be permitted.,,The Egyptian-International Coalition for Ending the Blockade and Rebuilding Gaza,Ahmad al-`Asi, General Coordinator,Egypt, 29 July 2011,,To help with the next convoy of medical supplies:,www.facebook.com/Lifting.the.Siege.on.Gaza,Ahmad al-`Asi [phone redacted] facebook.com/ahmed.r.elassy [email redacted],Ahmad `Abd al-Rahman [phone redacted] facebook.com/engarahman [email redacted],Ahmad al-Kurdi [phone redacted] facebook.com/ahmed.kurdyww [email redacted],Muhammad al-Sa`id [phone redacted] [email redacted],Abu al-`Ala Mustafa [phone redacted] [email redacted],","Palestine, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153035im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/untitled31.png,imgID313,

"Yes… The Constitution First, No to Incitement Against the Sit-in Protestors: Tagammu’ Party",2011-08-20,2011,"Yes…The Constitution First,No to Incitement Against the Sit-in Protestors,,[graphic]: Tagammu’ Party,,The reaction of the political-religious forces in refusing the decision of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces—in particular the Council’s “Constitutional Declaration Defining Principles and Foundations for the Formation of a Committee to Prepare a New Constitution Following Upon the Agreement of Political Forces and Parties”—shocked the forces of the revolution in their democratic parties and their revolutionary coalitions. This was because this declaration is in essence an attempt to extricate the country from the predicament of whether the constitution or elections should come first.,,These forces’ refusal of the decision was not enough, and through their statements they have incited against the sit-in protestors in Tahrir Square and in different governorates of Egypt, considering them, “responsible for obstructing movement, work, and production.” This in turn was broadcast in the weekly message issued from the Guidance Office [of the Muslim Brotherhood] on Thursday, 14/7/2011.,,Despite the attempts made by the Wafd Party through the Democratic Coalition (which includes more than 25 parties) to expand this coalition on the basis of a shared effort to refuse the elections law and hold fast to the law project which all the forces put forward to the Parliament and the Military Council, in addition to formulating a document of principles for the new constitution which was signed by all the participating parties, the position of the Brotherhood signals a retreat from this position, according to ‘Ala’ ‘Abd al-Mun’im, a member of the Wafd’s High Body. The Brotherhood’s true goal in joining this democratic coalition was revealed: it is to form a single electoral list without consideration for the priorities of the democratic transformation expressed in the necessity of the constitution first, an issue to which the Tagammu’ Party has held fast in all the sessions it has organized. Likewise, the statement from the Guidance Office took a condescending tone toward the people and their political forces when it discussed the ambiguity in the concept of “political forces” in the High Council’s statement.,,The position of the Brotherhood, and with it the al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya, Salafis, and [al-Gama'a] al-Jihad, lays down a divide between the political forces resisting the national consensus—who establish despotism and accuse those that hold contrary opinions of obstructing production and work—and those social and political forces that believe in democracy and are prepared to struggle to ensure the success of a democratic transition, which is the cornerstone in getting rid of all the forms of despotism that coexisted with the former regime and its allies. The attempt to portray the forces of the revolution as an obstacle to democracy, work, and production is unacceptable. The parties and the democratic forces must announce a united position toward all of this. We will not rally against the forces of the revolution with their demands for “freedom [and] social justice.” Our party will continue its efforts to unite the national and democratic forces for the sake of a modern democratic state built on the basis of equality between all citizens, man and woman, Muslim and Christian, rich and poor. Perhaps the statements issued by the leadership of the Wafd Party and some Egyptian political figures express this outlook. We ask the Wafd Party and its High Body to take into account the dangers in any electoral alliance with those forces that have revealed themselves to be opposed to both the civilian state and the guarantees advanced against the “Brotherhood, Salafi, Jihadi” project. Our party will continue its struggle with all other honorable forces to defend a civil, democratic and modern Egypt. The historical lesson that we have learned is that there is no appeasement, bargaining, or conciliation with those who try to empty the revolution of its social and democratic content. Let us strive to adopt a unified position for the sake of the constitution first, or at least for a constitutional declaration including constitutional principles expressing the aspirations of the Egyptian people: for a civil constitution that emphasizes pluralism and citizenship, along with social and economic rights for Egyptians.,,Tagammu’ Party,,17/7/2011,","Constitution, Constitution First Movement, Politics, The National Progressive Unionist Party (Hizb al-Tagammu')",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151859im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/untitled30.png,imgID315,

The Federation calls for participation in “Revolution First” Friday,2011-08-18,2011,"The Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions EFITU,,,The Federation calls for participation in “Revolution First” Friday,,to preserve the rights of workers and pensioners.,,The founding board of the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions held a meeting to discuss developments in the country’s economic and political circumstances. The board condemns the unacceptable return to the use of violence by police against the protesting families of martyrs and youths of the revolution. This started against workers by means of the unacceptable law criminalizing strikes, which violates Egypt’s international obligations. To achieve balance in labor relations, the board demands the rapid issuance of a trade union freedom law (which has become an necessary and pressing matter), as well as amending Labor Law 12 of 2003, given that the presence of real trade unions which speak for workers will lead to dialogue and negotiations through which stability in labor relations can be achieved.,,The leadership of the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions was surprised by the position of Dr. `Isam Sharaf’s government, which aimed to lay the cost of austerity solely on workers, pensioners, and the popular classes generally, despite the existence of many ways to fund the public treasury. The great calamity is that this all takes place in the absence of any societal or national dialogue, in which representatives of the three arms of production participate in negotiations about the path out of the crisis, and about how to distribute burdens so as to guarantee the country’s stability and stimulate the economy.,,The founding board condemns the finance ministry’s audacity in cutting 3.2 billion Egyptian pounds from the budget, which had been set aside to increase the lowest pensions by raising their minimum threshold to 300 Egyptian pounds.,,The Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions points out that economic and social demands were at the heart of the reasons leading to the January 25 revolution. Continuing to ignore them will increase the hardship and misery of the great majority of citizens, who still hope to achieve their basic demands:,,- A minimum wage for workers and pensioners that is graduated for all, commensurate with living expenses and increases annually in proportion to the rise in prices. This will provide them and their families a decent, dignified, and humane life. Additionally: setting an upper limit to employment income in the proportion of 1:10.,,- Adding 2008’s pay increase to pensioners, and graduating it throughout the years 2009, 2010, and 2011.,,- Implementing the progressive tax system, for workers, civil servants, and the poor alone cannot carry the burdens of austerity in order to get out of this crisis.,,- Implementing the law of taxing financial transactions and real estate taxes.,,- Eliminating collective allocations from salary budgets.,,- Ratifying the Trade Unions Freedoms law, which guarantees workers and business owners their right to form their independent organizations in freedom. This will ease the process of negotiating with them, and lighten the severity of congestion in the workplace. In this context, the Independent Federation reaffirms the necessity of accelerating the establishment of an independent negotiating body that will work to solve the most severe issues while awaiting this law.,,- Immediately suspending from work all those responsible for killing revolutionaries, and launching speedy, open trials for them.,,- Holding accountable all those responsible for crimes of corruption and wasting public funds.,,- Dissolving the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (which formed the labor arm of Mubarak’s regime and his National [Democratic] Party) and investigating the violations committed by its corrupt leaders, thus implementing the many judicial rulings issued against it.,,The founding board of the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions, as one of the elements making up the people and the glorious 25 January Revolution, calls on all the sons of the Egyptian people—especially Egypt’s male and female workers and pensioners—to participate heavily in “Revolution First” Friday, to affirm the revolution’s demands and the Egyptian people’s right to determine their own future, and to build Egypt on the foundations of democracy and social justice.,,The Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions,Founding Board,5/7/2011,,","Calls to Protest, Revolution, Solidarity, Unions",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152935im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/untitled28.png,imgID317,
Friday of Account-Taking and Open Sit-Ins 8 July,2011-08-17,2011,"Statement Number 12 of the Second Egyptian Revolution of Rage… A Statement with the Demands of the Sit-In on 8 July 2011,Friday of Account-Taking and Open Sit-Ins 8 July,,In light of what we observe regarding the revolution’s loss, its being stolen, the growth of voices wishing to tear it down, the heightened tone of frustration and discouragement, the repetition that the revolution has not achieved anything, the absence of the political will to achieve complete change on the part of those directing the country’s affairs, and our being pushed to accept half measures. This comes after the forces of the revolution split up and dispersed because of differences, which has led to losing sight of the goal, a weakened resolve, the absence of the cause, and the fading of revolutionary consciousness.,,And in light of our view that the country’s conditions under the leadership of the military council have only gone from bad to worse, and that the council has proved since day one that a policy of pressure is the most fruitful and successful way to realize the revolution’s lofty and legitimate demands. We decided to go out into streets and squares throughout our beloved Egypt and stage a sit-in until our demands were met. This was on Friday, 8 July 2011. We chose to set aside the controversial demands and emphasize the consensual demands—those upon which no two people disagree, those that unify the forces of revolution and keep it safe from dispersal and weakening—so as not to allow the country to follow the counterrevolutionary current, which is working for complete success.,,And believing as we do that only the bare minimum of the revolution’s goals were realized, we have decided that our demands are as follows:,,1 – A minimum wage of 1,200 Egyptian pounds and a maximum wage, with price controls to be compatible with those of limited income.,,2 – Public and secret trials of Mubarak, his children, his ministers, and his corrupt retinue, and all those who corrupted political life against us.,,3 – Honoring the [revolution’s] martyrs, compensating their families, and swiftly trying their killers.,,4 – Honoring the injured, treating them at the state’s expense, and providing them with compensation.,,5 – Depriving members of the former National [Democratic] Party of the right to political participation for a period of 5 years at least, putting the treachery law into action.,,6 – Immediately and completely releasing all political detainees and prisoners of conscience arrested either on or before 25 January through today.,,7 – Immediately halting military trials of civilians and retrying those civilians who were tried militarily before civilian courts.,,8 – Completely purging all state institutions, including all of the following: purging the police service of all previous leadership in the era of Habib al-’Adili; dissolving the National Security apparatus (previously State Security); purging the Egyptian judiciary and Attorney General’s office; firing the current Attorney General; completely purging the media and presenting guarantees of its independence; dissolving all local councils; choosing governors by elections and assuring that they be civilians and not former policemen or soldiers, in order to guarantee the civil character of the state and due to the civil character of the position; purging the universities of deans and State Security agents; purging banks and all the remaining state institutions of all the corrupt individuals, especially those belonging to the corrupt, defunct National [Democratic] Party.,,9 – Disclosing plans, supported by timetables, to eliminate unemployment and the problem of young people’s housing. We are well aware that this demand requires more time to realize, but we want to be certain that the political will for this exists.,,Let everyone know that the revolution’s demands have no limits as long as comprehensive democratic change has not been achieved. Its demands are still in the interests of our dear homeland.

It aims to transform Egypt into a powerful nation that rises to the station accorded it by its history. It also aims to make Egyptians steadfast in their character, so that they can compete with developed nations and achieve an improved quality of life, as a result of the following measures:,,1. The Egyptian state’s security, monitoring, and executive apparatuses should be restructured to guarantee internal stability, so that Egypt may have a strong foundation from within. The rulings issued on the corrupt individuals and figureheads of the previous regime should be rescinded, and instead the utmost punishments should be levied on them. Those who fled the regime should be brought to justice, and the money that the thieves stole from the people’s commonweal should be restored. Cultural artifacts that left Egypt during the corrupt years and up through today, should be returned to Egypt as well.,,2. The minimum wage should be raised to 1200 Egyptian pounds, and pensions and salaries should be increased by 50% as the first step. Market prices should be fixed in order to preserve this increase, so that the Egyptian citizen can experience an improvement in his quality of life. New career fields should be opened up in order to reduce unemployment. Capitalism should be encouraged on a national scale, and the spirit of competition given free reign in order to improve the quality of goods and services and to bring about a level of local confidence and surplus production. Housing problems should be rectified, and a comprehensive healthcare system should be put in place for all classes of Egyptian society.,,3. Free, high-quality bread should be produced and distributed widely, and new high-yield crops of wheat and grains should be planted. Resources should be allocated to developing Upper Egypt and other neglected areas in an effort to bring about societal justice.,,4. Attention should be given to the plight of those with special needs and the minorities, without discrimination, so that they may exercise their rights fully. Judicial independence and the strict rule of law should be set up, because this is the guiding principle behind individual efforts to combat corruption and reduce it across all spheres of daily life. This means sentences should be made harsher, the sentencing process should be expedited, and the proper resources should be allocated to this part of government carefully and in an unbiased manner. The Egyptian citizen should furthermore renew his commitment to his obligations and to the full exercise of his rights. Furthermore, civil society and non-profit service organizations should be empowered to work with the restored security and executive apparatuses to enlighten the average Egyptian. This will uncover new prospects for Egypt and improve its infrastructure, such as by generating more electricity.,,5. The education, cultural, and media sectors should cooperate for the common good of the Egyptian people, born anew in January but in need of further governance. Care should be given to each child’s education and the strength of his character. The family should also have a hand in raising him and preparing him to be a man of the future. Attention must be paid to his physical education (to promote a sound mind in a sound body) and to the use of his free time, so that the Egyptian people, who love soccer, may reach the World Cup in 2014.,,6. A new constitution should be instituted for Egyptians that establishes a civil society and every Egyptian as a free person. The Egyptian armed forces should also be developed.,,7. All international accords, treaties, mutual aid agreements, and previous contracts with foreign countries should be translated into Arabic and put up for review. This goes especially for the Camp David Accords and the Nile Waters Accord. They should be submitted for popular review and either endorsed or canceled. The utmost concern should be for cooperation between the Arab nations, who should commit themselves anew to strengthening ties and to solidarity behind the Palestinian people. They should be able to enjoy all of their rights and work towards lasting peace and justice. The enrichment of mankind will play a defining role in all areas of work. Each man will occupy the position best suited to his abilities, and all manner of opportunities will be extended to the next generation. That is our method for reaching the goals we hope to bring about. We will take into consideration the plight of our expatriate workers, considering them ambassadors of Egypt, encouraging them and providing for them. We will exempt all these Egyptians from paying taxes, for it doesn’t make sense for them to pay a poll tax to Egyptians living in Egypt. We will enact measures for what will be called “national participation” in accordance with each Egyptian’s ability and love for his fellow Egyptian.,,This program has not been reviewed for signature.

The quota of ten sacks is not enough to meet the demands of citizens, restaurants, and those who sell Kabobs. As a result, breakfast has become the only meal at which people can have bread. An increase in the quota for these bakeries will allow bread to be available all day for workers, and at breakfast, lunch, and dinner for citizens, restaurants, and Kabob salesmen. These taba’i bakeries have tasted a bitter fate at the hands of the officials of the Ministry of Food Supply. In 2004, these bakeries had a quota that was sixteen 50-kg sacks, and they were promised that this would become twenty. However, after their transformation from “baladi” bakeries to taba’i bakeries their quota became ten 50-kg sacks. All the while, the owners of these bakeries had to pay the insurance for their workers as well as capital gains taxes.,,The revolutionaries must pay attention to the matter of bread because citizens cannot live without it. The revolutionaries must seek an increase in quotas from the Ministry of Food Distribution for these bakeries in order to address the growing population. These bakeries also must not be seen as “new bakeries” because the Ministry has reduced the quota of the old bakeries and given the work to new bakeries. This reduction has encouraged some people to create tuk-tuk2 bakeries that serve the countryside.,,We want the revolutionaries to know that the person in control at the Ministry at the current time is Mr. Fathi ‘Abd al-’Aziz, the Supervisor and Director of Distribution. At this time he is doing the work of the Minister.

The Second Friday of Anger: The Revolution Continues,2011-08-13,2011,"The Second Friday of Anger: The Revolution Continues,,The 25thof January all started with an invitation from the heroic youth to the great people, who came out in unified rage to realize these three demands: Change, Freedom, and Social Justice.,,The First Demand: “Change”,,This aims at toppling a corrupt and dictatorial regime in favor of a truly democratic system. “This has not yet been realized.” Rather, we are advancing into a era no less deceitful than the previous one. Given the current political party law and the shortness of this transitional period, there will be remnants of the former regime as well as corrupt capitalist parties and extreme religious movements in parliament, and this will not represent the aims of the revolution or the will of the people.,,The Second Demand: “Freedom”,,Freedom for every Egyptian man and woman who lives in this county. “This has not yet been realized.” Rather, there are now plots to obstruct the aims of the revolution and sow discord, as well as a refusal to confront the security situation and deliberate delays in bringing the corrupt politicians to trial, a goal to which everyone is committed. As a result, the nation has become reactionary, sectarian, and divided. This is what threatens the security and its unity of the nation, making it easy prey to the ambitions and plots of Zionists and their supporters—plots that aim to divide the nation and destroy national unity.,,The Third Demand: “Social Justice”,,“It has become an impossible dream” under a political system that supports parties and other movements that do not represent the desires or interests of the people, but only advance their own personal ambitions and threaten the interests of the nation and its people. This warns of a widening gap between rich and poor.,,Because of this the Egyptian people announce “that they have felt no change… and are going back to Tahrir!!!”,,This is the second Friday of Rage that will complete the great revolution’s journey. We are determined to realize every aim of the revolution and help Egypt arrive safely at its destination.,,We Demand,,(1) The drafting of a new constitution for a civil, democratic state based on constitution, law, respect for freedom of thought, rights, and other freedoms. Also the reframing of the laws added to the constitution regarding political parties and, immediately, the laws related to political rights etc… in accordance with a broad public consensus surrounding these laws, not decisions made behind closed doors.,,The immediate dissolution of local councils, since they embody the corruption that is still present.,,The cessation of the political activities of members of the NDP in this parliamentary term, and then an extension of the ban for another year and a half.,,2) Creation of a presidential council made up of three to five members of the “National affairs Administration” for at least a year and a half. This council may take a number of forms, as long as there is consensus on it.,,3) Immediate imposition of an economic rescue program that includes:,,,,,,,,4) Formation of a revolutionary government, made up of youth groups whose special priority will be realizing the ambitions of the revolution.,,5) Cleansing the police force of the commanders, officers and security officials who participated in suppressing, humiliating, and killing the protestors, as well as criminal torture committed before and after the revolution. Also, bringing those who refused to do their duty by protecting the people and the nation to justice immediately.,,Immediately ending all plans to loot Egypt, e.g. …,,,,,6) Cleansing the Egyptian media and the future. Holding those reporters who promoted false news-stories against the members of the January revolution accountable for their actions. We also demand a revolutionary media which expresses the principles and aims of the revolution.,,7) Returning stolen money and immediately holding accountable the figurheads corruption on the charge of political corruption and grand treason.,,,The Egyptian People’s Revolution…………… A Revolution that will go on until victory,,,Be strong, my country……. freedom is being born!,,,The people want a new constitution… The people want to reform the country.,,,,No Sectarianism…….

It began to arrest all of those who demand their rights for a dignified life and beat the families of the martyrs in Balun and Tahrir. It refused wage increases with a claim of no money. It supports the power of the big capitalist factories, local and foreign, and, finally, it threatens the revolutionaries. Don’t forget the privileges that the military leadership obtained during the 30 years; they will leave their positions with whom? Not once did one of them oppose Mubarak or his regime. The Muslim Brotherhood are coordinating with them, and they are waiting to hand over the country to them and betray the revolutionaries and those demanding a Constitution. They are slandering them with Zionism while they are the ones negotiating with America, which sponsors Zionism! How patriotic is that? (the Brotherhood and the [Military] Council are one hand),,It is clear that the old regime still exists in every apparatus and institution, and that the same policy still exists, that of a free economy based on foreign investment and stock market speculation. It is clear that there will not be any change in anything: prices are increasing, unemployment is increasing, thugs are increasing. What is there to do? What is the way forward? The announcement of the revolutionary government from the square meets the aspirations of the people with the following decisions:,,1. Confiscating the factories, banks and companies that belong to the thieves.,2. Confiscating the funds of the thieves that were plundered and stolen from the people.,3. Restoring the state’s role in production, agriculture, and building homes for the youth.,4. Abolishing the rent laws for residences and agricultural land that threaten the stability of society.,5. Hastening the trial of the gangs for real charges: killing of demonstrators, destruction of Egyptians’ well-being, corruption of political life, oppressing the people, making them suffer, and subverting their will, not money laundering and after that innocence!,,Come on and let’s save Egypt with a revolution until victory,,The Egyptian Communist Party,The Revolutionary Wing,22 – 7 – 2011,","Politics, The Egyptian Communist Party",NA,imgID324,

When they did not sense true change they proclaimed their anger and were not deceived by the attempts to sideline their rights and their demands, going beyond the issues of the Constitution or the elections first to proclaim, “The revolution and its goals first.”,,Second: The revolutionaries revealed their awareness of the difference between the Egyptian Army and the Military Council, which Mubarak authorized to lead the country during the transition period, proclaiming, “the army is our army and the Council is not our President.” Thus, the Military Council is a continuation of the Mubarak regime that can and must be criticized and evaluated on its performance.,,Third: The only guarantee for progressing towards achieving the goals of the revolution (change, freedom, and social justice) is popular pressure on the Military Council and the government and constant observation of their performance through the use of peaceful means of expression such as the demonstration, the sit-in, the strike, and even civil disobedience if the situation requires.,,Despite the victory of the revolutionaries in forcing the resignation of numerous figureheads of the National [Democratic] Party in the previous government, such as Mish’al, Hawwas, and others, the demanded change remains—a change in policies and not only a change of individuals.,,Therefore, the millions of revolutionaries emphasize the necessity of the government’s making a good faith effort and orienting itself with the trajectory of the revolution through issuing a set of urgent resolutions that return the revolution to the course of freedom and social justice. These resolutions are:,,1. Quickly securing retribution for the martyrs through fair and public trials of Mubarak and the figureheads of his regime and imprisoning and trying the killers of the martyrs and the snipers that have remained free until today.,,2. Abolishing military trials for civilians and retrying those arrested before a normal judiciary.,,3. Abolishing the shameful law criminalizing sit-ins and strikes that Sharaf and the Military Council issued, which even Mubarak did not dare to do.,,4. Raising the minimum wage to 1200 pounds and assuring the placement of a maximum wage to not exceed the minimum wage by more than 15 times. Following the revolution and until today hundreds of advisers in the government (the Ministry of Finance, for example) and high-ranking officers in the army and police have earned a monthly income of hundreds of thousands of pounds, while millions cannot find their daily bread.,,5. Imposing mandatory pricing on basic goods before the explosion of prices during Ramadan and making the state assume its responsibility to set prices through directly importing basic goods (such as sugar and oil) instead of leaving the people prey for the sharks of the monopolist importers.,,We, along with all the revolutionaries, will continue the sit-in and participate in protests until real change occurs favoring the millions of Egyptians with the lowest of incomes and not the handful of businessmen who plundered Egypt for thirty years.,,Contact: [phone #'s removed] or Facebook – The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,,","Military, Military Tribunals, Politics, The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151550im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/untitled20.png,imgID325,

They believe that achieving this comes through insistence, determination, and faith.

After the passage of six months since the revolution, a mechanism has not been put in place to implement a single development project of the projects that were presented by scholars, intellectuals, and researchers from among the true, dedicated nationalists. Nothing has changed in the style of administration in every sector. Corruption, bribes, monopolies, and high prices remain (all this corruption for the benefit of whom?).,,They themselves try to circumvent the revolution and empty it of its goals.

They will continue to drag their heels until the people grow tired and divisions take place between some of the people and others, as is happening now.,,This is promoted through the official media directing attacks at the participants of the sit-ins on the pretext that they are stopping the wheels of production, although they know that that corrupt wheel, from the days of Mubarak and up to today, turns in the one direction, in the interest of those who own millions. They claim that high costs are because of the revolutionaries, although the system of monopoly of goods is a product of the Mubarak regime, the revolutionaries do not control the markets or authority, and knowing that we are a consumer (importing) state and not a producer.,,Are the families and relatives of our righteous martyrs and those that stand in solidarity with them thugs?,,Those present in Tahrir Square and the squares of Egypt participating in sit-ins are among the finest children of the homeland, from the full spectrum of professions, and they will not give up on the prosecution of Mubarak, his associates, and the corrupt police officers who killed the martyrs.,,To all the fathers and mothers and the young men and women, consider that the plots that are taking place will bring us back to how things were before revolution in terms of humiliation and suppression of freedoms, and our poverty will increase until we die from hunger so that those holding power and millions will increase their wealth.,,Oh people of Egypt, rights are not granted, but grabbed by force.

Think with Muhammad al-Sha’ir,2011-08-10,2011,"Think with Muhammad al-Sha’ir,Let’s look into the trap set for the Revolution and try to uncover what is hidden..,,Of course everyone knows about what happened the day before yesterday and yesterday to the families of the Martyrs.. I will tell you what happened in detail and pose important questions about important matters. I want to engage minds and begin research and thought processes in order to arrive at correct and convincing opinions about everything.. The beginning of this story is a foundation called the Shihab Foundation, which is a charitable association. It is not well-known. This association wanted to coordinate with Madhat Shalabi, the famous broadcaster, in order to honor some of the families of the martyrs, and they, i.e. Madhat Shalabi and the association, chose ten families from among eight hundred.. Reason dictates that Madhat Shalabi played some role in this. There was an investigation about what role this was, but we still don’t know the results. The way he honored the families was to give each family one thousand pounds, along with either a television or a tape player.. The place and time were chosen; the place was the Balloon Theater at the Salah Jahin hall, and the time was 5 pm on Tuesday.. Up until this point, everything seemed to be normal and natural. What was unnatural began after that, when the guests, i.e., the families of the Martyrs, were greeted by a photo of Mubarak on one of the walls in the hall. Here we ask, had this picture been there since the Mubarak Era or was it intentionally placed there?? And if it had been there since the Mubarak era, are those who manage the theater remnants of the Regime, or were they simply absent-minded?? In either of these situations, the picture of Mubarak points to some flaw.. What happened was unnatural also because Shalabi brought in a song and dance troupe to entertain the families of the Martyrs while grief for their defenseless children who were killed and martyred was still fresh in their hearts. The only crime these children committed was wanting a free nation and their stolen rights back. Rather than respecting the tragedy that had befallen these families, those holding this event threw salt on their wounds when they brought in this troupe.. It was like a man going to pay his respects for someone and bringing a band, a singer, and a dancing girl with him. Tell me, what reaction do you think this dolt would get from the family of the bereaved and all who are present? During this ceremony, at exactly six-thirty, cars carrying thugs arrived, and with them were four women so that they could pretend to be families of martyrs. These thugs got out of the cars, headed towards the hall, destroyed it, and beat the families of the martyrs. They fled, and no one was arrested except for two people, who are still under investigation.. Eventually matters became clearer, and the malicious, scheming, pre-meditated intentions became apparent.. After this, the families of the Martyrs went to the Maspero building and told the whole story to the other families who were protesting there. The whole group was indignant and enraged, and went to Midan Tahrir to protest what had happened because this was a premeditated crime, committed together with terrorist attempts to pressure them into dropping their cases.. These families, whose children—now martyred—wrote out the glory of the revolution with their blood, rather than being honored, were beaten and treated inhumanely—these fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers of martyrs. This, rather than the trial of Mubarak’s helpers, those corrupt and criminal murderers.. What matters is that this entire group began chanting angrily against Mubarak, the Military Council, and the Ministry of the Interior, because they were angry and crushed by what had happened to them. This was around eight or nine pm.. Then some people came and said that some of them had been beaten in front of the Ministry of the Interior. This is what they told me, for I had been present for part of what happened at the Balloon Theater and had not gone to Midan Tahrir.. In the case of those beaten at the Ministry of the Interior, the intention was particularly clear, that is, to lead the protestors to the Ministry of the Interior in order to expose the Ministry in an unfavorable light, and to create animosity between the people and the Ministry of the Interior. I think the same people caused all of these problems, because I don’t think the Ministry of the Interior would have dragged these families there in order to incite problems against itself with this incident, if it were members of the Interior who had caused this problem.. What the families reported also made matters more ambiguous, because they said that thugs came out from the Ministry itself, throwing Molotov cocktails at them. Who would use this tactic and this deception? What did they want, and what were they hoping for??.. In Midan Tahrir, at the same moment, teargas canisters and nerve gas (which temporarily paralyzes a person) were being fired at the protestors. Many of them were hit and later depicted online yesterday, Wednesday, holding a great number of these gas canisters.. What is simultaneously surprising, strange, and suspicious, and what merits further research is that these canisters being used said: “Made in Israel,” and some of them said: “Made in America.” The date they had been manufactured was this past May 13, and if these dates were correct, it means that America, Israel, and the Military Council are all implicated in this.. i.e., in attacking the Revolution and the revolutionaries. This is only if the dates were correct, in which case the Military Council would also be harboring negative intentions toward the Revolution, because it would have imported anti-revolution and anti-revolutionary weapons last month. The dates confirm that their intentions are clearly against the Revolution.. And if the dates were fabricated, i.e., if those canisters were made in Egypt or even in another Arab country, or a non-Arab country, this confirms that someone has a criminal hand in tampering with the Military Council and the Revolution, and is trying to create animosity and strife.. Bullet casings were definitely found in the hands of the Military Council, and there are currently investigations into dozens of people. Perhaps this will clear matters up for us and solve these puzzles. For those waiting, I am………………………………. Muhammad al-Sha’ir, Tel.

The Social Democratic Forum: Labor and Liberating the State,2011-08-07,2011,"The Social Democratic Forum,,Labor and Liberating the State,,Labor Day, the first of May, arrives this year, 2011, to unprecedented circumstances: a democratic revolution sweeps through the Arab countries, Egypt and Tunisia, Libya and Syria, Yemen and Bahrain, a revolutionary storm uprooting tyranny, corruption, and inequality. The working class has participated and led the Egyptians’ struggle—sit-ins, strikes, demonstrations—since the first period of the tyrant Hosni Mubarak’s accession to power. Who among us forgets the strikes of ESCO, al-Mahalla, and Kafr al-Dawwar. Who among us can ignore the railway workers’ strike and the steel and ironworkers strike in Hilwan. The time has come to salute the first martyr of the Egyptian revolution, the worker `Abd al-Hayy al-Sayyid, who was assassinated by the bullets of Central Security within the walls of the steel and ironworks in the 1980s. The working class was the first to resist the tyrant Hosni Mubarak, when the workers shut ESCO of Shubra al-Khayma in his face, and received him with strikes and protests on 28 April 1986. 6 April 2008 was a distinctive day in the history of Egyptians, acquiring its weight and significance when the workers of al-Mahalla tore down his pictures, stomping on them with their feet and chanting for his downfall; when the Egyptian working class revealed the state of discontent and resentment by negotiating student sit-ins on the sidewalk of the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council; when it decided the battle for his departure from power, by joining the demonstrators and protesters in the major cities of Egypt on Thursday and Friday, 11 and 12 February. Mubarak—and his ruling clique—destroyed and sold companies and factories; laid off workers; halted recruitment; marginalized 40% of the people; surrounded Cairo, the capital cities, and the governorates with slums and poverty belts; exported Egyptians in semi-slavery to the Arab and international labor markets; took over their savings and their pensions; forced them into early retirement to near beggary. He deserved the people’s curses and rage and they ejected him from power, and there he is imprisoned in the hospital of Sharm al-Shaykh. His sons and the pillars of his rule are in the prison cells of Tura. Today, the workers of Egypt celebrate without him, and without the degradation: “A favor, O president, a bonus, O president.” For the working class is not only the workers of the factories, workshops, and farms, but all those who work for a wage and do not own the means of production, scientist .. doctor .. engineer .. lawyer .. accountant .. etc.,,If Egypt is now at a crossroads, between retreat to a totalitarian state—religious or military—or a democratic state and parliamentary republic, redistributing power and wealth, let those deprived recover their stolen share through a new constitution. [A new constitution should] formulate a civic identity to liberate the state from tyranny and autocracy, from sectarianism, dictatorship, and bureaucracy, and an incremental program to restructure wages and incomes.

Reexporting to the Arab scene as its public face the same obsolete personalities who, largely, played the hypocrite, groveled, and were broken before the deposed president and his corrupt regime, means that Egypt has not changed. It is well-known to all that Mustafa al-Faqi, whom Egypt nominated to this elevated position, entered the People’s Assembly fraudulently, as attested to by Councilor Nuha al-Zayni.,,Al-Faqi is the same one who accepts that any future president of Egypt must first receive the approval of America and that Israel not object to him. He is the one who was willing to die protecting Mubarak until the last moment; who described him as not “Ben `Ali,” as brave and intrepid, only a few days before the revolution succeeded. Just as he supported the accused Petroleum Minister Samih Fahmi’s nomination as a representative in the People’s Assembly and was keen to attend his electoral conferences. He was also demanding the extension of the Emergency Law during sessions of the People’s Assembly.,,When the revolution succeeded, he denied his past positions and leapt onto the scene, claiming to be launching arrows of criticism and censure at the former regime, despite the fact that he was swimming in its praise only hours before. This is because he is adept at playing all sides.

It believes that this nomination is not appropriate for Egypt in the present moment and does not serve the Arab situation in any way.

Is the revolution that which makes a criminal of the one who demands that his family’s hunger be staunched, charging him for sit-ins and strikes? And in contrast, the military council and its government submits to the stockbrokers when it only hesitated at a tax being imposed, even just 5%. The businessmen refused and the military council submitted and complied with the request of the millionaires immediately.

We say to them …. don’t be deceived by your power ….. and the money of your businessmen, for the people will not give up on their revolution, which you are trying to steal from them, to the extent that you laugh at the people “long live the revolution .. but let the people die of hunger” ….

The revolution will take hold of this deteriorating economy because of its systematic corruption and your thievery and for no other reason.

So let you return to us our money. Our land .. Our rights ..

The Salafi Front in Egypt: Shari’a is the Basis of National Consensus,2011-08-06,2011,"The Salafi Front in Egypt,Statement # 008,,Shari`a Is the Basis of National Consensus,,In light of the Islamic forces’ agreement to descend on Tahrir Square to express rejection of the announcement of the “document of governing articles for the constitution”, which represents a jump over shari`a and circumvention of the people’s will, and the events that came after it, it is necessary to clarify the following points:,,First: Shari`a must agree with the identity and culture of the society just as it must be built upon the people’s will, as happened in the first honest referendum in Egypt, the result of which was positive in favor of constitutional amendments.,,Second: Despite our appreciation for the position of the Military Council for its protection of the revolution and its achievements for the people against the oppressors and the corrupt, and likewise its continued assurance of handing authority to an elected civilian government, it is necessary to establish the following:,,- The Military Council’s delay in heeding legitimate revolutionary demands and the failure to achieve but a few of these—under pressure from the street—is what incites chaos and thwarts stability.,,- The subservience of the Council to the influence of limited groups, as happened with the announcement of the formation of an illegitimate committee to put in place “governing principles for the constitution.”,,- Accusations made by some political groups without presenting official evidence or taking the necessary legal steps, despite the fact that these groups had been allowed to participate in the meetings for national consensus and special recommendations about ministerial formation.,,Third: The Front denounces the unfortunate events in `Abbasiyya, in which the April 6 Movement withdrew from the national consensus, and emphasizes the following:,,- We unequivocally reject all attempts to destabilize or shake the Egyptian Military on the pretext of the split between the Military Council and the armed forces.,,- We reject all forms of illegal confrontation with the April 6 Movement and those in solidarity with it, such as using thugs [al-baltagiyya] and smearing [opponents] with political accusations; this extends to some honorable people and returns the atmosphere to what it was prior to the 25 January Revolution.,,- The Front calls for the necessity of reviewing the positions of all the organizations that receive funding from abroad, and not focusing on one organization in particular.,,Fourth: We emphasize that national consensus does not mean shuffling the deck and nullifying the legitimate demands of the Islamists. So the goal this Friday is, clearly: a rejection of the so-called “governing principles” and everything connected to them in terms of illegitimate decisions and committees.,,God speaks the truth and He guides the way,,The Salafi Front in Egypt,27 July 1432 / 29 July 2011,","Religion, Salafism",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130160354im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/untitled2.png,imgID351,

Besides that, we have achieved nothing.,,Today we see the Muslim Brotherhood accuse anyone who says “Constitution first” of being in league with Zionism and America, while liberals accuse the Brotherhood of opportunism and anyone who said yes to the referendum of ignorance.

It has buried the plan for family inheritance in order to keep for itself the legacy of the July regime with its devices intact, calling it a counter-revolution in cahoots with the reactionary forces and the businessmen, in order to reproduce the divisive and subordinating regime that marginalizes the people, discriminates against them, and impoverishes them. It’s safe to say that the military institution has monopolized power and resources since July 1952, during which time—more than half a century—Egypt did not know foreign rulers. Now we must wonder whether Egypt truly benefited from the rule of this institution’s leadership, beginning first of all with guarding and preserving the country’s borders and its national leadership.,First: With the separation of the Sudan from Egypt the southern borders of the country have deteriorated.,,Second: The national leadership abandoned a sixth of Egypt’s eastern countryside in the Sinai after it brokered the first and second disengagement and the Camp David Accords, a humiliating and degrading set of agreements.

It has killed its citizens at sea, on the train, under boulders, and on the stage.,,And in terms of culture:,,Egypt has not produced writers, thinkers, litterateurs, or artists of the caliber that it did in more liberal times.

"Justice Party Notice Regarding Participation on Friday, 8 July",2011-08-03,2011,"Justice Party Notice Regarding Participation on Friday, 8 July,Tuesday, 5 July 2011 – to be distributed,,As a political party born of the revolution, the Justice Party believes that it is the eternal legal right of the people to demonstrate peacefully in order to bring about their lawful demands, with the condition that these demands be clear and well laid-out and that the demonstrations be well-coordinated by participating groups. The Party believes in this right so that the people can ensure that they do not lose other rights, and so that individual demonstrators or organizations, public or private, do not find themselves in danger. Due to this, and in light of national convergence on a set of clear, lawful demands, the Party decided to officially take part in the peaceful demonstrations on the appointed Friday, 8 July, calling for these rights and seeking to enshrine the successes of the revolution, guarding against a relapse into old ways. In the view of the party, these demands are presented as follows:,,,There is no doubt that reform of the security apparatus, in light of the abuses that occurred in the past and ending with the killing of protesters during the revolution, is an absolute, immediate necessity. With this, reform of this apparatus is the only guarantee to return safety to the streets, a matter of utmost importance for the success of a transition to democracy in a suitable climate. Likewise, it is a necessary part of restoring domestic stability, and from there improving the nation’s economic health. In light of what has been proposed, the party demands the following:,,2. Matters of Justice,,The Justice Party believes that justice is the highest value that political, legal, and legislative organizations can hope to pursue. Likewise, the realization of justice, under a framework in which the law prevails and citizens are equal before the law, was and still remains the principal demand of the revolution. On this premise, the party demands the following:,,,3. Matters of Democratic Transformation,,There is no doubt that the goals of the revolution will not be achieved without a successful democratic transformation on a basis of peace, something for which many have sacrificed . This is what calls for a clear road map to achieve this success, one that surmounts polarized factions by being based on a national consensus. Accordingly, the Justice Party demands the following:,,The Justice Party calls on all national powers to agree to these demands in order to complete the achievements of the revolution under a framework of national consensus and unity on behalf of the country. The Party asserts that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, as the highest executive and military power in the land at the present time, is responsible for realizing and meeting these demands, especially since its alignment with the revolution requires that it guide the country, uninterrupted, through the present transitional period and as it is charged with securing the success of the revolution and nothing else.,,The Justice Party,20 ‘Aisha al-Taymuriyya Street – Garden City – next to the Four Seasons,Call Center: 16309 – www.facebook.com/eladlparty,,","Politics, The Justice Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151944im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/scaled.%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A3%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%A8-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88-0.png,imgID356,
"The Egyptian Communist Party: The Revolution First- Friday of Purification, Retribution, and Social Justice",2011-08-02,2011,"The Egyptian Communist Party,,The Revolution First,Friday of Purification, Retribution, and Social Justice,,Despite the passage of five months since the success of the 25 January revolution in toppling the head of the deposed regime, the primary goal of the revolution—that is, the overthrow of all of the organs, institutions, and symbols of the regime—has, until now, not been realized. The old regime still remains, and the conspiratorial scheme to abort the revolution still surrounds it on all sides. The forces hostile to the revolution from outside, at their head the United States of America, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and their allies, lie in ambush with the internal counterrevolutionary forces, which still nest in every corner of the organs and institutions of governance and the state and especially in the Ministry of the Interior.,,This scheme would not have succeeded in provoking this dangerous situation if not for the government’s and the military council’s slowness, inaction, and inability to take immediate steps to secure, safeguard, and continue the revolution. This is reflected in their failure to undertake processes of total purification in all institutions, at their head the Ministry of the Interior and the media; their slowness in prosecuting the killers of revolutionaries; and their bias in favor of businessmen and the rich at the expense of the demands of the revolution to achieve social justice. It has reached the point of prosecuting workers before military tribunals while killers, thieves, and the corrupt stand before regular courts, which are either postponed, issue rulings that let them go, or declare their innocence!,,On the other hand, the demands of the current of political Islam, at its head the Muslim Brotherhood, to expedite the holding of elections with the goal of kidnapping the revolution and reaping its fruits, whatever its intentions, serve this conspiratorial scheme. It has even reached the point that the Muslim Brotherhood accuses those demanding the postponement of elections of being agents of Zionism and the Americans. These accusations reveal their mentality of accusing those who disagree with their view of being infidels, of terrorism and treachery, and this is what requires decisive condemnation by all forces and withdrawal from any alliance with them.,,Therefore, the Egyptian Communist Party, with all the nationalist and democratic forces in the National Assembly for Change and the National Council, all the popular and youth groups, and the Egyptian masses, call for a demonstration on Friday, 8 July, in Tahrir Square and in all the squares of the governorates, to save their revolution and unify their forces under the slogan “The Revolution First.” Although saving the revolution requires beginning by putting in place a new constitution and reconfiguring the transitional phase, what is urgently required now is to press, using all peaceful means, for restoring the revolution’s true path and to pressure the government and the Military Council to implement the urgent demands of the revolution, primary among them:,1 – Just, immediate, and public trials for the killers of the revolution’s martyrs and swift trials for those implicated in financial and political corruption, at their head Mubarak and al-’Adili.,2 – Purging the Ministry of the Interior’s apparatus, restructuring it, and suspending those of its officers and employees who are implicated until the end of their trials. Rejecting pressure on the families of martyrs and attempts to blackmail them into conciliation under any name. Confirming the necessity of purging the government and all state institutions, such as universities, the media, companies, banks; dissolving the government labor union; and banning the leadership of the National Democratic Party from taking part in politics for two election cycles.,3 – Immediately increasing the minimum wage to 1,200 Egyptian pounds with an upper wage limit not exceeding 15 times the minimum wage. Disbursing an unemployment allowance to university graduates and the unemployed and imposing a progressive tax on the rich. Increasing budgetary allocations for education, health, and housing and refusing to burden the poor with the austerity plan proposed by the government.,4 – Immediately halting the trial of civilians before military tribunals and freeing the demonstrators who are being tried in front of them.,5 – Rejecting undemocratic laws, among them the parties’ law, the criminalization of demonstrations and strikes, and the law regarding the exercise of political rights, and demanding that elections be held by an unconditional proportional list system for all seats.,,6 July 2011 The Egyptian Communist Party,Telephone: [redacted] Email: [redacted] Website: www.cp-egypt.com,Our Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/cpegypt,,","Politics, The Egyptian Communist Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152058im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/untitled6.png,imgID357,

Al-Bayumi said in a telephone interview with the Arab media network “Moheet” [“Ocean”] that “demonstrations and sit-ins are the legitimate right of every citizen, but they are not a pastime for those with nothing better to do,” claiming that there was “a clear response from the authorities to the demands of the demonstrators and those staging the sit-ins.”,,He added: “We said that Tahrir Square is there and will not go anywhere, and we should give the authorities concerned full opportunity to address the demands. When the authorities are slow to respond to the demands, then we will return to the square.” He pointed out that continuing the sit-ins and strikes would influence the wheel of production, and called on all demonstrators to return to their work and continue production, of which Egypt is in dire need right now. For his part, Dr. ‘Isam al-’Aryan, vice president of the Brotherhood’s “Freedom and Justice” party, confirmed that the party would not participate in the demonstrations scheduled for the coming Friday, indicating that a large number of the revolutionaries’ demands had been realized and it was necessary to leave an opportunity to realize the rest of the demands.,","Politics, The Muslim Brotherhood",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151816im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled21.png,imgID359,

The revolution raised up the slogan “Bread… Freedom… Social Justice” and its goal was to completely topple the regime. However, this has not happened up to now. The head (the deposed Mubarak) has fallen, but the body (the system of corruption and despotism that is spread throughout the state’s different institutions and foundations) has not yet fallen.

During this incident, the young woman’s words faltered, and she said some incomprehensible things, among them that she was working with a gang to kidnap children.

A dispute broke out between participants in the sit-in who held that the young woman should be handed over to them, and those who said she should be handed over to the hospital for nervous and psychological illnesses.

Fire trucks succeeded in controlling the blaze after the council was fully incinerated. Revolutionaries in Damietta accused the leadership of the deposed National [Democratic] Party of being responsible for fire, in the interests of disposing of any evidence condemning them or the deposed local council, as some of those staging a sit-in in the vicinity of the council feared that these parties would smear them with the charge of setting the fire. On top of this, electricity was cut to the area to avoid a short circuit, and the armed forces closed off the streets surrounding the building.,,",Regime,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162154im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled21.png,imgID365,
The Egyptian Communist Party: And What Afterwards?,2011-09-26,2011,"And What Afterwards?,,After the passing of the six months that were specified by the Military Council as the time-frame for handing over authority, there has not been any real change in favor of the masses. Rather, things keep getting worse day after day since the superficial referendum, the goal of which was for the Military Council to wrest the legitimacy to rule away from the hands of the revolutionaries and the search for the revolution’s demands (change – freedom – social justice).,,We find the political scene like so: change is a sham, freedom is shackled by the emergency law, the law criminalizing demonstrations, the law governing political parties, the practices of civilian and military police, and trying civilians – whether January revolutionaries or family members of martyrs or striking workers – in military courts. Thugs are left to wreak havoc across the country, while social justice has become a dream far from ever being realized after the government and the Military Council have stubbornly insisted on not raising the minimum wage to 1200 pounds. Furthermore, they have delayed establishing a maximum wage and continue supporting capitalists at the expense of the poor. They raise prices without restraint and insist on selling cheap gas to our enemies so that the people will give up on their revolution and pray for the mercy of the days of humiliation, the days of the deposed dictator.,,And here you are, seeing that the military police after the revolution does not differ from the civilian police before it, that the generals of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces surround themselves with who they themselves labeled “sons of Mubarak” and the people who said “We’re sorry, Mr. President”. You’re seeing the civilian police viciously beat the families of the martyrs in front of the police academy during the deposed dictator’s trial and beat the al-Ahly Ultras when hurled insults at Mubarak and al-‘Adili. This led to the death of one fan and the injuring of dozens more, plus the arrest of 16 others. Indeed, the Interior Ministry, the Military Council, the businessmen, and sometimes the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis are “one hand”. The people, who are owners of the revolution, are besieged by starvation, robbery, the emergency law and military courts.,,Indeed, people went out to demonstrate against poverty, hunger, unemployment, inflation, instability, and the fear of the unknown. They went out to demonstrate hoping for a safe and secure life, but the 25 January Revolution did not bring class or social change, or freedom. Moreover, the capitalist regime is still present, and so are the policies of an exploiting and monopolizing capitalism. So, where is the revolution whose slogan was “Bread – Freedom – Social Justice”? It’s a purely socialist slogan, although the 25 January Revolution now, unfortunately, is under the control of the regime and the ruling capitalist class.,,Oh great people of Egypt, real change doesn’t come except with the struggle of workers, peasants, and the entirety of the noble proletarians. They are the owners of the common interest in social, political, and cultural change in favor of the majority of the people and all of the oppressed in society. Indeed, real change does not come with an uprising that does not include everyone, but with a popular revolution that includes a leadership and a program expressing the common interests of the majority of the people.,,Indeed, the 25 January Revolution is the beginning of a true socialist revolution that will do away with poverty, unemployment, greed, bad services, and the era where the only choice we had was to beg from those who stole our daily bread, as if healthcare, food, clothing, shelter, and true learning were not basic rights of the people. It is the people who produce the goods and suffer deprivation. It is the people that brought forth martyrs and reaped nothing but sorrow!!,,Oh great people of Egypt (workers, peasants, employees, students, and proletarians), oh noble ones, do not desert your revolution. Complete the journey so that we attain all of our demands, the most important of which is social justice in a secular state—not a religious or military state, a state of equality, justice, freedom and knowledge.,,Long live the struggle of the Egyptian people Long live the noble stuggle,Email: [email redacted],The Egyptian Communist Party (Cairo) [telephone #'s redacted],,","Politics, The Egyptian Communist Party",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152049im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Untitled1.png,imgID366,
Sitting In .. Until the Regime Falls,2011-09-26,2011,"[The Square Today, #7, Page 2],Sitting In .. Until the Regime Falls,,“The people want the overthrow of the regime.” This was the slogan of our revolution from its beginning up to today, and we insist on continuing our revolution until this demand is realized. Meanwhile, the counterrevolution is working to empty the slogan of its substance by changing the regime’s major players without changing the regime itself, with all of its institutions, policies, and social and economic biases.,,Before he was deposed, Mubarak tried to circumvent the revolution by changing the government. But the revolutionaries refused to accept crumbs, and adhered to the slogan “the people want the overthrow of the regime.” After he was deposed, the military council made its own attempt [at circumvention] by changing the personalities more than once, but we adhered to our slogan, “the people want the overthrow of the regime.” Today they are playing the same game with us, changing the names in the ministry without altering the government’s economic and social orientations. This is what we must reject. We continue to raise up the slogan “the people want the overthrow of the regime” until the regime actually falls and the revolution sets up its own regime based on its slogans of freedom and social justice.,,The slogan for the overthrow of the regime did not emerge from a vacuum. The proletarian, producing, and impoverished classes that fueled the revolution and ignited its blaze did not hope, by their revolution and the blood of their martyrs, to exchange individuals with individuals. They wanted to change the entire regime, all of its institutions and its symbols—a regime that so often sided with Egypt’s rich without regard for its poor, treated the poor popular classes as its enemies, and insisted on impoverishing them more and more. The proletariat wanted to establish a new regime that would side with Egypt’s poor—at the heart of them the workers and farmers—and put them at the forefront of the mind when making any decisions or laws.,,We in the Union of Socialist Youth confirm the continuation of our sit-in until the revolution’s goals have been fully realized. We believe that first and foremost now, aside from punishing the killers of the [revolution’s] martyrs, is agreement on revolutionary policies, establishing a state of social justice in Egypt, such as: a minimum wage of 1,200 Egyptian pounds and a maximum wage not exceeding 15 times this; canceling energy subsidies oriented toward the rich; canceling export subsidies; immediately implementing a law confronting monopolies in a real way; imposing a progressive tax; imposing an unemployment allowance; increasing support for the poor; and others. In so doing, let us lay the foundations of the new regime. After that, names will not concern us greatly, so long as they helped implement the revolutionary policy upon which the revolutionaries agreed, and as long as they were not from the degenerate National [Democratic] Party.,,All democracy for the people .. all devotion to the nation.,,The Union of Socialist Youth,Tahrir Square, 18 July 2011,,Watan Network… live coverage of the revolution, from the heart of its events.,http://www.facebook.com/WNN.NEWS,,[graphic],Watan News Network,WNN,,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163130im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled21.png,imgID367,

There is no Freedom or Dignity without National Liberation,2011-09-21,2011,"There is no Freedom or Dignity without National Liberation,,A couple of days ago, one of the foreign ambassadors said that Camp David Accords do not apply except to those who took part in them. They do not apply to anyone else. We, the sons and daughters of the Egyptian people — workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and professionals — were not a party to these accords at any time. We have never agreed on normalizing relations with Israel, planting the Zionist embassy in the heart of Cairo, or to the QIZ Agreement that requires that our exports to the United States of America have an Israeli component. Since the signing of this humiliating convention, not a single occasion has passed except that the Egyptian people expressed their rejection and lack of recognition of the accords through protests, issuing statements, organizing campaigns to interrupt it, and forming commissions to show solidarity with Palestinian people’s Intifada in 2000. That year witnessed the people returning to the streets in strong protests for the first time in more than two decades. This was then followed by demonstrations, sit-ins and protests in all aspects of social, economic, and political life. These came about because of the subordinating relationships between the Egyptian regime and world imperialism with its financial institutions and their Zionist essence.,,At all times in the past two decades the protesting against subordination was connected with the protesting against the regime’s policies and with demanding the severing of relations with the Zionist enemy: whether in the year 2000 or 2003 during the American invasion of Iraq using the Egyptian airways and waterways; then once again in 2006 during the Zionist assault on Lebanon; then again in 2008 during the unjust war against Gaza; and then finally the bombing of Gaza and Egyptian borders which resulted in Zionist weapons martyring four Egyptian soldiers and one officer on Egyptian soil. What the young man, Ahmad al-Shahhat, of al-Sharqiyya did when he removed the Zionist flag and planted the Egyptian flag in its place was nothing more than the Egyptian youth fully embodying the demands of the Egyptian people.,,Every time the Egyptian regime adopts a disgraceful position that shows its lack of will and ability to adopt decisions and respond to the people’s demands to close the embassy, expel the ambassador, and sever relations, even though in this instance the martyrs are men of the armed forces and the Military Council. They should have been even more likely to be the first one to seek retribution for their deaths.,,The January 25 revolution that cast down the regime’s head was clear in its demands to bring down the entirety of regime, including the regime’s policies, its social, political, and class-based biases, and the subordinating relations that tie it to the Zionist entity and American administration. It was due to these relations that the previous regime yielded its sovereignty on all the lands of Sinai in exchange for assistance that poured into its coffers.,,Today it is not possible for us to speak about the revolution being successful unless we destroy this subordination, abolish this humiliating pact and all the accords that resulted from it, and close this embassy which represents an aggression against the people’s desire and will for freedom and dignity.,,There is no freedom or dignity with the presence of Zionism on Egypt’s land. There is no freedom or dignity without severing all relations with the Zionist entity and abolishing all accords that Sadat’s and Mubarak’s regimes agreed to as a price to please the American administration. There is no freedom or dignity as long as Egypt continues acting like a guard dog on the borders of al-Sharqiyya for the benefit of the Zionist entity.

The Police: Between Accountability and Tolerance,2011-09-20,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 1, Page 1],The Police: Between Accountability and Tolerance,,Thirty years of serious violations of Egyptians’ rights committed by the police across the length and breadth of the entire country… For thirty years, the police force has been sheltered by the notorious Emergency Law so that it could spread panic and fear throughout all of Egypt. Thousands of Egyptians were killed by torture in police slaughterhouses and State Security Headquarters, while tens of thousands of Egyptians survived torture, and continue to ruminate over wounds to spirit and body year after year. They saw their executioners, morning and night, strutting about freely in the knowledge they would not be punished, while their victims felt the sharp sting of injustice due to a legal system that separated them from their executioners.,,This is the savage State Security force. Its influence and the scope of its action spill into every aspect of life. It has final say on appointments within universities and scientific research centers. It has the power to prevent or allow academic research. It decides what parties and social civil institutions can and cannot be founded. It gives the green light for appointments to state newspapers, media outlets, and so on. On the other hand, it is the apparatus that arrests those in the political opposition or those who may be linked to the opposition. It tortures at will and illegally detains without notifying families of their children’s places of detention, forbidding them from contacting lawyers. Should they be freed from the State Security Headquarters, these detainees are moved to prison. Successive release orders are of no use, since before the detainee even sees sunlight, a second detention order will have been published, to the point that some detainees have gotten more than thirty rulings for release that have not been carried out.,,In the depths of the cells, in total isolation from the outside world, the systematic torture is carried out with impunity as attorneys do not have the right to search the places of detention. Additionally, the victims of torture cannot tell who exactly it is that tortures them.,,As for the police departments, and the investigative bureaus in particular, their scandals are well-known. Every citizen on Egyptian soil has been a potential victim of torture, not only those suspected of having committed a crime, no matter how serious or insignificant. Some torture on behalf of a third party, others torture in order to force people to admit to fabricated crimes, and still others torture because someone dared to raise a court case against those who tortured them. Yet others are tortured because they refuse to work as informants or because they refuse to pay the required extortion fees.,,And yet the police were not content with the crimes which are classified as crimes against humanity at the current number and breadth. Indeed, their abhorrent history culminates in facing off against peaceful demonstrators with live ammunition, running them over with armored tank wheels, and releasing thugs from prison to terrorize the people and confront the demonstrators.,,Police violence is not strange under this regime. However, it is strange and deplorable that we now hear voices calling to forgive the murderers and blood-letters, turn a new page, and unite together by returning to the slogan, “the police serve the people”! They have violated the sanctity of homes, murder after murder, torture after torture. Will modifying the behavior of the police and getting retribution from the perpetrators be enough to modify the slogan? Should we not, before turning a new page, open every closed torture file, whether it was done in police department detention centers, State Security, or prisons? Should not the citizen’s dignity be restored before we ask his tolerance?,,Should not the police force be purged of anyone found to have been involved in torture or mistreatment of citizens during the past thirty years and throughout the popular revolution?,,Should not the Egyptian law, which assisted in their avoiding punishment, be amended so that we are reassured that justice will stand against the perpetrators should they return to violate the rights of citizens? Should we not be reassured that the judicial authority, investigative bodies, and Forensic Medicine Authority are truly independent from the executive power?,,If you are serious about change, put them on trial.

The Nasserist Revolutionary Statement to Restore the Revolution to its Path,2011-09-18,2011,"[Logo]: The Arab Democratic Nasserist Party,Freedom—Socialism—Unity,,THE NASSERIST REVOLUTIONARY STATEMENT TO RESTORE THE REVOLUTION TO ITS PATH,,September 9: Towards revolution once again, together we are working towards eliminating the remnants of the regime and building a modern, civilian state.,,The fact that our revolution is under siege and facing attempts to abort it is evident in two ways – both in form and in content. Regarding the form, the police are once again employing their wicked and criminal practices. Also, the dirty State Security forces have once again started monitoring, interfering with, and pursuing the revolutionaries.,,Regarding content, there are deliberate attempts to wipe out the current state of patriotism and populist sentiment, to incite the Egyptian people’s official media outlets against the revolution, and an unacceptable sense of courtesy is being shown to the remnants of Mubarak’s insolent regime. There is also an unprecedented invitation to sectarian strife and confessional conflict pushed forward by regional figures trying to constrain Egypt’s role and its revolution in order to stem the revolutionary fervor before things explode in the Persian Gulf. There is also an organized effort to destabilize the Egyptian economy and push the people into a state of hunger and poverty, and to deprive the market of essential commodities. There is also an organized effort to strangle any popular attempt to save the Egyptian economy and stop the incitement of people against the revolution by falsely deluding them into believing that the revolutionaries are sabotaging the country. Furthermore, the Zionist entity’s assault on the sovereignty of the Egyptian state, its violation of Egypt’s borders, and its execution of a planned, open attack in cold blood on our virtuous, brave soldiers in the Sinai necessitates a similar response—or expelling the ambassador at the very least—out of consideration for our dignity and patriotism as well as out of consideration for deterring the enemy. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The transitional regime and Prime Minister Sharaf’s government were content to remain tight-lipped, making statements that could be classified in the same category as those from the weakling Mubarak and his fallen regime. We cannot accept this.,,All of these actions and attempts to abort the revolution—to sow despair in the minds of the great masses and our great people—have driven us to announce our support for those who go out into Egypt’s city squares, into its mosques and churches and factories, to generate support for continuing the revolution on the Friday of Restoring the Revolution to its revolutionary, consensual, patriotic, and civilian path, working specifically towards social justice and national independence.,,Also, we believe that there is no way to rescue the revolution unless a revolutionary Salvation Council is formed. This Council would include all of the revolutionary forces present in society without exempting or marginalizing anyone—without tutelage, opportunism, or the prioritization of narrow criminal interests.,,Oh Noble Citizens,Fostering dialogue and limiting inequalities in the framework of revolutionary and political action are central tasks for all revolutionary forces. Such dialogue will help us eliminate the remnants of the regime. In another respect, helping revolutionary action regain its momentum and spread its peaceful message by creating various tools and forms is currently considered a priority of the revolutionary forces. And in the context of wanting to support and strengthen joint revolutionary activities, thus granting them prosperity, creating other, joint revolutionary groups at the national level is closely associated with preparing to build a revolutionary council to rescue the revolution on the general and comprehensive national level.,,Oh Brothers of the Revolution,Beware and work… Beware of narrow, opportunistic interests and work towards the unity of the revolutionary forces.,,Brothers of the revolution and great people of Egypt: Lastly, we call on all of the masses of the great revolution to gather and go out on Friday, 9 September, to defend Egypt and the revolution. We renew the call to all of the revolutionary factions to form a revolutionary Salvation Council, open for everyone to join. Thus, we affirm our desire for dialogue with all of the political and revolutionary groups, in an effort to achieve the goals of the revolution and build the new homeland that we Egyptians seek.,,Glory to the revolution and eternity to our martyrs, and long live the struggle of the free Egyptian people.,,The Arab Democratic Nasserist Party,September 7, 2011,,","Calls to Protest, Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152012im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled17.png,imgID376,

The Current of National Independence,2011-09-15,2011,"The Current of National Independence,,Statement 4—Friday of Popular Will,,With the extension of the revolution and the widening of its scope of action on different paths and different levels, we felt it necessary to reemphasize the revolution’s central goals, so as not to not lose the compass or waste blood and sacrifices.,,Indeed, if the revolution does not lead to a strong state—sovereign and independent on economic and political levels—will be an incomplete, limited revolution, bounded by interests that cannot be transcended or violated. This course of events works in the favor of domestic power centers with political and economic interests, as well as hegemonic foreign powers interested in keeping Egypt’s situation weak and without any active role locally or regionally. Therefore, we felt it necessary to affirm the following:—,,1. That the revolution has not yet ended, and that much remains for it to accomplish before it can lead us to a state of justice, freedom, security, and dignity. “Half-made revolutions are the funeral shrouds of peoples.”,,2. That the only path to the revolution’s success is by uniting under the auspices of basic and universal revolutionary goals. So let us stop with the language of accusations and betrayal and uphold the banner of unity. All attempts to fragment, contain, and circumvent the revolution break down when faced with unity.,,3. That the independence of nations depends on the independence of peoples, and that a strong state is a state where individuals are free, able to choose their fate and make their future. “Since when do you enslave the people when their mothers bore them as free men?”1,,4. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Peoples who do not exercise their role in holding its leadership accountable are peoples who institute corruption and tyranny, embracing humiliation and degradation. There is no authority above scrutiny and account. “There is no authority above the authority of the people” “If I do well, help me; and if I do wrong, set me right.”2,,5. There is no alternative but to restore Egypt to its regional role as a state capable of securing its strategic depth and protecting its vital interests. “Nothing scratches your back like your own fingernail.”,,6. That economic independence is the gateway to building a productive national economic example, free from the system of dependency and Western depletion of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This is a vital demand, and we have no alternative if we wish to produce a true renaissance and support the independence of Egyptian political decision-making. “He who does not possess his power does not possess his freedom.” No to foreign debts. Let us be guided by the Malaysian experience.,,7. That independent Egyptian political decision-making and the reformulation of foreign agreements and treaties in a balanced manner, taking into consideration Egyptian interests, is the beginning of restoring Egypt’s regional and civilizational role and its economic renaissance. “No to military and economic aid.”,,8. That the world does not perceive any language but that of power; therefore, Egypt has no alternative but to establish an Islamic Arab regional bloc to be the midwife to an ambitious, unified project of revitalization.,,Without independence of individual will, there is no independence of the will of the nation [umma] … and without economic and political independence … without independence of the individual, the nation [umma], and the economy, there is no renaissance and no sovereignty.,,We acknowledge the role of the great Egyptian army in lifting the cover from the head of the previous regime. With his departure, the army hastened to give Egyptians a shot in the arm and protect the capabilities of our dear Egypt. We emphasize that it was the duty of a son to his mother and a trust in the hands of the military establishment, and Egyptians were not stingy with what was dear and precious. They offered their loved ones as support in a time of need and as security in a time of fear, performing a duty and returning a good deed.,,The price of doing one’s duty will not be that Egyptians mortgage their freedoms and the fate of their nation to be forever subject to the guardianship of the army’s leaders. Let us go back in time several decades, to dictatorships under which Egyptians tasted the scourge of abuse, injustice, and oppression; dictatorships inflicted on Egypt which resulted in a state unable to secure a drop of water for its sons and daughters, a state which insulted its sons and daughters, holding for them no power whatsoever.,,The giant has emerged from his slumber and freed himself of his constraints.

The People’s Revolution Continues,2011-09-14,2011,"23 July 1952 23 January 2011,The People’s Revolution Continues,,After taking into consideration the last statement of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and reaffirming its fundamental, supportive position regarding the revolution of the great Egyptian people and also after basing itself on the party’s concern for the security of Egypt and preventing—or, rather, completely foiling—the plan to draw Egypt into the labyrinths of chaos and to unleash a battle among the sons of a single nation, the Nasserist Democratic Arab Party announces the following:,First: our determination to continue the revolutionary momentum through bringing about the downfall of all figureheads of the regime and prosecuting them in a just, expeditious, public, and quick trial and also by paving the way for reviving the energies of the country in order to build a powerful and independently willed Egypt and to render its people honorable, free, productive, and equitably blessed with the fruits of their labor.,Second: the party announces that the legitimacy of the Supreme Council to administer the affairs of the country came solely through the revolution of the Egyptian people. The Supreme Council acquired this legitimacy through the acceptance of all the masses of the people not through the former president or a referendum. Instead, the constitutional proclamation is a translation of this revolutionary legitimacy. Consequently, the Supreme Council loses its legitimacy if it does not express the popular will as announced through the document of demands put forward in Tahrir Square and other squares in Egypt.,Third: the party clearly and conspicuously announces its rejection of the way the statement was delivered as it primarily contained threats and promises rather than adhering to the spirit of the revolution, expressing its demands, or recognizing that it possesses legitimacy and that those who go against the demands of the revolution are the ones who go against this legitimacy.,Fourth: the party values continuing the spirit of the revolution and the liberality of the Egyptian people and salutes the consciousness of the people and its revolutionary vanguards that crystallized in demands. We will fight together in order to achieve them in full.,Fifth: the party has studied what appeared in the statement with regard to responding to some of the demands raised by the revolutionary masses in Tahrir Square and the other squares in Egypt, and this has confirmed that rights will not be forfeited and that the revolution will not be completed until the entire Egyptian people rallies under its banners, raising demands and repeating the slogan “The Revolution First”, realizing that a deficient revolution is a total loss.,Sixth: the party realizes how many sacrifices the great Egyptian people have made and what a heavy price they have paid until now. The party confirms its support for the Egyptian people’s request for security and stability. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, in its capacity as ruler of the country according to the constitutional proclamation and the Ministerial Council, in its capacity as the executive power, are completely responsible for the deteriorating security situation, the lack of stability, and the increase in prices. All of this is the result of their slowness in achieving the demands of the revolution—specifically purging the state’s institutions and agencies and the whole country of the figureheads of the former regime and prosecuting them in accordance with revolutionary legitimacy for political crimes prior to holding them accountable for material crimes—and their slowness in purging the Interior Ministry of corruption, perpetrators of crimes against humanity, and the killers of the revolution.,Seventh: the party announces that the time has come to form a unified political leadership of the revolution to represent it, to negotiate in its name, and to raise demands. This leadership should consist of representatives from all of the coalitions, political powers, and parties that participated in making the revolution and the current sit-ins in Tahrir Square and the other squares in Egypt. It is possible to agree on the mechanisms for choosing members.,The Nasserist Party invites you to attend the activities in remembrance of the 23 July1952 Revolution. These activities are scheduled to be held on Friday, 22 July, in Tahrir Square at the time of Friday prayers, an event entitled “From the 23 July 1952 Revolution to the 25 January 2011 Revolution: the People’s Revolution Continues.” Nasserism is a revolution that cannot be calmed and a series of principles that do not die.,Long live the knowledgeable and sovereign Egyptian people,The Nasserist Democratic Arab Party,,Nur for Printing: [[phone # redacted],,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161658im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled13.png,imgID380,
The Hydrocracking Catastrophe,2011-09-13,2011,"The Hydrocracking Catastrophe (A Project of One Million Killed),by the Egyptian Refining Company in Musturud,,Gamal Mubarak is the real owner of the Egyptian Refining Company, which according to its description is one of a group of companies held by Citadel Capital. His associates are Ahmad, son of the writer Muhammad Hassanayn Haykal, and Marwan Nabil ‘Abd Allah al-’Arabi—Egypt’s foreign minister—as well as others.,,* After his father failed in politics, governance, and in securing his succession, Gamal Mubarak has come to kill our future generations with cancer, and he continues to plunder our money and resources with the cooperation of ‘Abd Allah Ghurab, the current minister of petroleum and the right hand of Samih Fahmi.,,* The environmental effects of the project, to be undertaken within days (The Project of One Million Killed):,,First: The Atmospheric Emissions from this Project: They consist of harmful, dense gases like carbon dioxide, which will be dispersed in the atmosphere in amounts reaching up to forty tons daily; large quantities of poisonous gases, like twenty-nine tons daily of carbon monoxide and 202 kilograms daily of sulfur dioxide; gases contributing to acid rain, for example, 33.7 tons daily of nitrogen oxide; as well as greenhouse gases like methane; and dangerous organic compounds like hydrogen sulfide gas — the most dangerous poisonous gas in existence.,,*** Its effects: First, with regard to the people of neighboring areas like Musturud, al-Khusus, Shubra al-Khayma, and al-Khanka, the emissions lead shortly (within a few months) to various cancers, infertility, the loss of embryos or their deformity, and chronic asthma. As for the residents of Greater Cairo, in the long run (several years) they will experience the same maladies.,,Second: despite the problems Egypt now faces with regard to water from the Nile, this project was approved. Yet it consumes enormous amounts of water from Isma’iliyya’s waterways, which are the source of water for several of the treatment plants from Musturud to Isma’iliyya governorate. As such, they are also the source of water for all agricultural lands in these regions. The Egyptian Refinery Company intends to draw its water for cooling from the Isma’iliyya waterways at the rate of:,,2,600 cubic meters every hour = 155 thousand cubic meters daily = 155 million liters daily,,Third: After using these enormous quantities of water in the cooling and refining of hydrogen for fuel, large amounts of organic waste and liquid compounds are to be disposed of in the waterways of Isma’iliyya at a rate of 1.5 million gallons daily. These are among the most poisonous and dangerous gases in existence, and they will eliminate all the living beings in the Isma’iliyya waterways and destroy all of the agricultural land up to Isma’iliyya. These organic wastes will react with chlorine from the water treatment facilities from Musturud to Isma’iliyya, leading to a human catastrophe for all who drink from the water. It will directly cause humans to contract deadly diseases.,,This project will cause wide environmental destruction, according to the environmental report released by the Institute for Environmental Studies at ‘Ayn Shams University and authored by the most important scholars in this field:,,1. Dr. Ahmad Mustafa al-’Atiq / 2. Dr. Hisham Ibrahim al-Qassas / 3. Dr. Taha ‘Abd al-Azim Muhammad ‘Abd al-Raziq,,* And there are many questions for ‘Abd Allah Ghurab, the current minister of petrol and the right hand of Samih Fahmy:,,1.Why did you move quickly — after the revolution — to implement this catastrophic plan despite the fact that the deal was signed years ago?,,2. For whose benefit are you hiding the suspicious sale of Musturud to gigantic oil companies, at a price of 106 pounds per meter paid to the Egyptian Refining Company? Those are the companies that heap billions upon the state treasury each year!!!!!!,,3. Why are you hiding the millions of dollars that the Egyptian Public Authority and the Egyptian banks paid to the Egyptian Refinery Company, as Japanese and Korean banks refused to fund this catastrophic plan?,,4. And finally… do you not fear God’s wrath as you present deadly cancers that will sicken the children of Cairo when this project is implemented?,,","Mubarak and Family, Regime",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155420im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled11.png,imgID381,
Husayn Sidqi Mosque Restoration in al-Ma’adi,2011-09-12,2011,"In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate,“[B]e helpful to one another according to goodness and piety, but be not helpful for evil and malice.”,God Almighty has spoken the truth.,His Eminence, the Esteemed Doctor ‘Isam Sharaf, Prime Minister of Egypt (Egypt of the Revolution),God’s peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.,Husayn Husayn Sidqi, son of the artist Husayn Sidqi, organizer of restoration, remodeling, and charitable works at the Husayn Sidqi Mosque in al-Ma’adi, beside which my late father is buried and which was inaugurated by Mr. Muhammad Naguib, President of the Republic, Mr. Gamal Abdel Nasser, Mr. Anwar Sadat, and all the members of the Council of the 1952 Revolution, along with the Shaykh of Al-Azhar Muhammad Shaltut and the Minister of Religious Endowments al-Shaykh al-Baquri, presents to you:,The Topic,Since the Mosque is situated at the entrance to al-Ma’adi, and this is an extremely sensitive area, and as the density of worshipers has increased, people have begun praying outside the Mosque during the summer and winter due to the extreme congestion. This in turn has caused road closures at the primary entrance to al-Ma’adi during times of prayer. The Mosque is built on load-bearing walls, and we obtained restoration and remodeling permits for it, but when the work was undertaken, a large part of the Mosque collapsed such that the drainage has been corroded and become dilapidated. Now, due to the demand of the governorate’s previous leader that part of the Mosque’s land be given up to improve traffic-flow by widening the Egypt-Hulwan Agricultural Way, we have begun to build the Mosque on less of the same area and at a lower height. As a result, some have lodged complaints, which resulted in the Resolution of Removal #3865 of the year 2011, Resolution #3160 of the year 2011, and Resolution #3073 of the year 2011.,Since what the legislature intended with this removal was to protect lives and properties, then if the building is completed in accordance with the architectural system, its structural regulations, and the Egyptian Earthquake Code, and if the project is supervised by a knowledgeable expert, the underlying reason for the Resolution of Removal would disappear and it would have to be withdrawn. This is what has been agreed upon by jurisprudence, the ruling of the Court of Cassation, and the Supreme Administrative Court. There is compelling circumstance which has necessitated the construction of a concrete foundation for us due to the sudden collapse of the sanitation system and other parts of the Mosque.,We have developed the Mosque which sits at the al-Ma’adi entrance with an architectural style that is consistent with modern architecture and in harmony with the original architectural form that distinguishes al-Ma’adi as an architecturally protected zone and an aesthetic area of the capital, Cairo—one in which most of the foreigners and diplomats in the Arab Republic of Egypt live.,Based on the above,Please withdraw the Resolutions of Removal that have been issued concerning one of the houses of God (The Mosque of Husayn Sidqi), an historical mosque that has been slandered and which is similar to the houses of worship which you worked and strove to establish and restore. Everyone has witnessed your wisdom in similar situations, and then you had the foresight to nip sectarianism in the bud.,Attached are photocopies of the permits for the Mosque and the Resolutions of Removal.,I have also taken it upon myself to develop the square and private garden in front of the Mosque with my own money—my way of participating in the area’s enhancement and returning beauty to our dear Egypt.,If you would like us to send your lordship the signatures we have collected from the al-Ma’adi area and the worshipers at the Mosque of Husayn Sidqi, all expressing their dissatisfaction, extreme anger, and astonishment regarding the Resolutions of Removal, we are prepared to immediately send them to your lordship. They are confident that the ones who made the complaint—the reason behind the Resolutions of Removal—are people of bad intentions, and they are wondering how you can treat houses of worship differently within the fabric of the nation.,Presented for you,by the Custodian and Charge of the Mosque of Husayn Sidqi,Air Force Captain Husayn Husayn Sidqi,","Culture, Religion",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155830im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled10.png,imgID382,

Also, for Egypt’s Islamic identity and respect for the popular will that rejects the constitution’s governing principles.,,Antagonist: Okay, is there someone who spoke about Egypt’s Islamic identity?,,Supporter: Yes, the association responsible for the governing principles for the constitution,,Antagonist: Okay, what about these principles doesn’t please you? Or do you guys want a theocracy as people are saying?,,Supporter: No sir, we don’t want a secular state or a theocracy in the western sense. We want an Islamic state. This Islamic state would be one with organizations in which the people would freely express their will—on the condition that no one violate the law.,,Antagonist: Even so, I still don’t understand why you reject these principles.,,Supporter: First, because there is no such thing as “principles above the constitution” because the constitution is the highest document in the state. Second, these principles won’t express the nation’s will because they will change with any referendum. Rather, this is a small group of people who want to impose their opinion on everyone. Third, the people that are demanding these principles are associated with the “Constitution First” group as well as with The Presidential Council. When their plans failed and the people exposed them, they attempted to rally around the “popular will” with these principles.,,Antagonist: Okay, and why are they doing this?,,Supporter: Because they want Egypt to be a secular state. And because they knew that this is currently very difficult, they attempted to decrease the roll of Shari’a in the new constitution.,,Antagonist: What’s the proof of that?,,Supporter: There is a lot of evidence, including that all of those who now call for these principles are the same people who once demanded that Article II of the constitution be removed or at the very least amended. Also, Muna dhu al-Faqqar, a member of The National Council for Human Rights, continues to say that “amending the form of Article II of the constitution has been agreed on. That is already in the endorsed document for the constitution.”,,Antagonist: Fine, there’s another reason why I won’t go.,,Supporter: What’s that?,,Antagonist: It’s that those who are going are those Islamic groups and I don’t follow any such group.,,Supporter: Obviously this isn’t true, because those who are going are all Muslims who love their religion and Shari’a, plus all the noble Egyptian people, even those who are not Muslims, because they respect the popular will.

The Workers Want the Dissolution of the Union,2011-09-04,2011,"Center for Trade Union and Worker Services,Winner of the French Republic Human Rights Prize,,The Workers Want the Dissolution of the Union,,After the verdict to dissolve the National Democratic Party, the Administrative Court ruled to dissolve all of the Local Councils. The reasons given for the court’s ruling were that “the Local Councils derived their legitimacy and existence from the previous regime that corrupted and destroyed everything beautiful in Egypt, and the Local Councils were among the tools used by the regime to achieve its goals.” This description also applies to the Union of Government Workers, which is another organization that derived its legitimacy from its dependence on the previous regime and from the membership of leaders of the dissolved National Democratic Party that bullied workers using the power of the disbanded State Security and Investigative Services. Moreover, this government union has been an instigator of hostility against the Egyptian Revolution since its outbreak on 25 January when it issued statements and hostile attitudes toward the revolution and its leaders participated in the demonstrations supporting the ousted president. There is no greater evidence supporting this than the fact that the president of this union, Husayn Mugawar, a member of the former People’s Assembly and the president of the Workforce Committee of that corrupt assembly, is now imprisoned pending investigation into the incidence of assault on the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square on 2 February, known in the media as the Battle of the Camel.,,This union, despite all of the crimes against the rights of workers and citizens it committed—not only collaborating with departments of companies to force workers into early retirement or its leaders brokering the sale of public sector companies, but also that it was the administrator of the trade union for the previous regime that played a large role in setting the stage for the production of hereditary succession— despite all that, its leaders now claim to support the revolution and announce their faith in its principles in an attempt of circumvention and camouflage until the opportunity presents itself to them, along with the remainder of the opposition forces, so they can pounce on the revolution of the Egyptian people.,,For this reason the government of Dr. Sharaf should not wait for the ruling of the court on the case demanding the dissolution of the union completely as it did in the cases of the National Democratic Party and the Local Councils. Instead, it must make a decision consistent with the slogan of the Egyptian Revolution “the people want the fall of the regime”: a decision for which millions of Egyptian workers whose rights were wasted by the union are waiting, a decision for which thousands of families of martyrs and victims of our great revolution are now waiting, a decision to dissolve the Union of Government Workers and to have trials for all of its corrupt leaders due to the sources of their wealth.,,Center for Trade Union and Worker Services,8 July 2011,","Solidarity, Unions, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152807im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled2.png,imgID390,

The Try-to-Understand Movement,2011-09-02,2011,"The Try-to-Understand Movement,,We are youths who decided after Egypt’s noble revolution of 25 and 28 January to go down into the street and meet its people’s desires, their future aspirations, and what they hoped the revolution would achieve for them, their children, and their grandchildren. We decided the following:,,1. We will work to communicate the objectives and content of the revolution to the people in every household and on every street in Egypt so that, with time, these matters will not confuse them. For example: defining social justice and the extent of its ability to spread the spirit of equality and justice among members of society.,,2. We will heighten society’s culture by making this movement’s web page into a specialized publication through which we spread true and useful information, the veracity of which we verify by virtue of our education and our various studies, experiences, readings, and investigations. We can thereby produce an educated generation capable of creative thinking based on true information—a generation that can advance sound opinions based on knowledge, not on rumors and information received from superficial sources.,,3. We will try to avoid political debate and criticism for criticism’s sake, so that we do not separate the nation’s ranks from the unity which we hope will cause them to converge upon a single, social goal on which all agree. We aim to attract all ideas and persuasions, exploiting the potential of their proponents in order to return concrete results1—not intangible words—to society.,,4. Public works: These will be exemplified in adopting ideas that can be implemented, not ones that are complicated and require the intervention of a government sector capable of offering significant funding to be implemented. For example: health insurance, improving roads, etc. There are some simple ideas that we can carry out at lower costs, and their return will be of great benefit to society. For example: spreading a culture of productivity in companies, purifying the courts of bribes, and raising electoral awareness.,,5. We will spread the culture of popular oversight and effectuate it in society, for it can play an effective role in reducing corruption to a minimum.,,Finally, we have faith in our ability to do public work, and we believe in the importance of vigorous social movement that aspires to spread knowledge, culture, and public social work based on [ ... ] our love for the nation, whose soil we love. We look forward to coordinating with the concerned authorities, private associations, coalitions, and organizers of initiatives. Ultimately, our goal is to promote the concepts of community and advantageous social movement, for we believe that sound understanding leads to good works for the country.,,For inquiries, you may contact ……… [telephone number redacted],Visit our Facebook page: The Try-to-Understand Movement [Harakat Hawil Tafham],","Movements, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141732im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/untitled1.png,imgID392,

Thus ‘Ayn al-Sukhna road was cut off for a period of 10 hours, and a sit-in was held outside the Suez Canal Authority extension building in the Port Tawfiq region, threatening to disrupt traffic.

The Revolution of the Martyrs,2011-10-21,2011,"The Revolution of the Martyrs,Why the revolution was launched,,A long time ago, our grandfathers sacrificed their lives and all of what they owned to expel colonialism from Egypt and to recover our dignity and freedom, so that we could live in pride and dignity and enjoy freedom. In spite of the fact that there was an occupation, and in spite of the fact that it provided a generous life, easier than what we have now, where children in school received the best education and were treated to everything from education to health and nutrition, and it was called “occupation.” Our grandfathers were not satisfied with this, though money and power enticed them. They were honorable because they were convinced of one thing, and that was dignity. Our land is our dignity, and indeed every inch of Egypt’s land was liberated. Then came the leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, who completed the progress of freedom, pride and dignity. He gave a great deal to Egypt and took from it love and sacrifice. After him, the leader Anwar Sadat came in order to continue what the leader Gamal Abdel Nasser had begun. But, unfortunately, traitors carried out an assassination so that the people would not enjoy freedom. It was a Jewish scheme orchestrated by collaborators and traitors; they are the murderous, corrupt regime. Then the corrupt regime—at its head the murderer, collaborator, thief, and violator, all meanings of words of corruption are not enough for him—seized the country with an iron fist, and this was his first and last slogan. He starved your people, stripped them of their dignity, violated their rights, arrested them, and destroyed their lives. These traitors and killers will be obedient and servile to us. They thought that Egypt and all it contains were their possessions, and that the people were their servant and prisoner. Trust me, these killers are not human, because there is no human in this world who can do what they did over the course of several decades. I say to you that no Jew, no infidel, no demon, and no devil could treat their people the way the murderers treated their loving, peaceful people. I would like to say to you that the devils, the demons, the Jews, and the infidels brought legal action against the entire regime. So we said to them, why? And they said, because they are superior to us. Oh honorable revolutionaries, it is said that you are as one from among the ministries. The Ministry of Health means the Ministry of Death for the Poor and the Ministry of Health for the Rich. They treat the rich, the powerful, the whores, the dancers, the actors, and the football players for free, at the expense of the poor. Even the most inexpensive treatments are outside the reach of the poor, and the costly treatments and expensive operations are done abroad for certain people in the country. I am writing these words because I am a person who passed through these conditions, and I am not writing anything from my imagination. You know this well, and this is only one from among many ministries, about which there is much talk. The corrupt regime is what produced the thief, the murderer, the thug, the drug dealer, the beggar in the streets, and the whorehouses that they in fact manage, and which invite young men and women to take the lost and forbidden path.,,Brother citizen, I am sure that there are those of you who will still, after reading these words, say that there is the good path and the evil path, and each person is responsible for [his] actions. I would like to say to you that this murderous, corrupt regime was fighting any path that led to good and pity. I will tell you how, and this is one example from among a thousand true examples. When there is an old mother raising seven children, from toddlers to teenagers, and they do not have what they need for living expenses, [medical] treatment, food, or clothes, or… or… what will become of the children when the mother is sick and needs someone to care for her and her children, who cannot work because of their young age, or because there is no work for them? Oh honorable brothers, if not for the mercy of our lord, then Egypt and all of its people would have burned for such widespread corruption. Those criminals and killers are merchants of corruption in Egypt. All of this greatly satisfies the Jews and America. They looted our money and our wealth and smuggled it to the Jews in order to boost their economy and help them produce weapons which they use to kill us. These are the people who boosted foreign economies with our money and plundered treasures.,,They looted everything from Egypt. They stripped her of everything, as they might do with a person in a detention camp: not only of his clothing, but also of his honor. There is lots and lots of talk, you free revolutionaries, my brothers. When I was alone in Tahrir Square, an officer in the army asked me, and he said to me, “Isn’t it shameful that you all attack the soldiers?” My response was “of course it is shameful,” and I said to him, “But isn’t the blood of the martyrs shameful, and aren’t the injured shameful, and isn’t it such a shame about those who have (been) disabled, and, and, and…” etc. And I said to him, “I want to ask you a question, officer. Could you, if you were the judge in a trial, could you put al-Shuwaysh ‘Attiyya[1] on trial?” His response was silence, and I said to him, “Can al-Shuwaysh ‘Attiyya try his father?” and he was silent again. Believe me, oh honorable, pure people, what is happening in Egypt right now is a play. Al-Shuwaysh ‘Attiyya plays his role, and the remnants of the corrupt regime—the regime of thugs—play theirs. And those who put the black curtains in the cage of the accused on trial try nothing, my brother revolutionaries…You honorable ones, I say it with all frankness and clarity: Is it reasonable for a son to judge a father? Is it reasonable for a boy to judge the leader of his crew? Is it reasonable for a servant to judge the governor he serves? Is it reasonable for a corrupt regime to judge itself? This play’s goal was to extinguish the revolution and return the revolutionaries to their homes. This play, my friend, revolved around one part of the regime surrendering political power and the rest of the regime, my friend, will continue the play until the time of your escape. We will provide you with everything you hope for in terms of protection and recreation, and after that the remainder of the regime will rig the elections and limit which of the members can run. They are the National (Democratic) Party, but under the name of a new party. You know what I mean. The members of the deposed party will seize positions in the state, and a new president will be chosen to complete the play in order to free the rest of the regime, which is allied with the Interior (Ministry) and the thugs. My honorable revolutionary brothers, everyone from the corrupt regime has arranged his papers and smuggled Egypt’s money abroad—they’ve even smuggled their families abroad—because there are plans to expel these traitors and murderers, if they are even still here, which I doubt.,,Goals of the Revolution,The goal of the honorable revolution—the martyrs’ revolution, the revolution of dignity and sacrifice, the revolution that the lord of the universe protects—was very clear. The revolution’s goal was not to boost the country’s economy and increase wages only until the time when they would retract these changes and laugh at the people, making a residence where only silence could live. The revolution’s goal was to help the people reclaim their rights, which had been violated over the years. The revolution’s goal was to help the orphan children. The revolution’s goal was to help the poor families that sleep in ruins. The revolution’s goal was to help the street children, the elderly who live on the street, and those that sleep on the sidewalks. The revolution’s goal was for every mother, father, child, young man, and young woman to find generous and healthy care, for there to be a safe home and a clean life for them. They reclaim their rights for the good of Egypt, for Egypt’s wealth is for its people, not for the thieves and killers. Our goal was for every young woman and man to find a safe home, to reclaim their rights for the good of Egypt, that they might complete the life that lays ahead of them. There is much talk because the gang is huge; the gang is in all the ministries, government bodies, and universities, on every street and path in Egypt. Oh honorable revolutionaries, the sacrifices have been massive. Trust me, I am an Egyptian citizen from the heart of Cairo, and it was my honor to be with my brothers in Tahrir Square from the beginning of the revolution. I was one of those wounded by three rubber bullets. I don’t belong to a political party, and I am proud to have been among the revolutionaries, demanding martyrdom in order to retrieve the rights stolen by the oppressors. I conclude my words by saying to the honorable revolutionaries—symbols of pride and dignity—do not withdraw from Martyrs’ Square—Pride Square, Dignity Square. Do not withdraw until we have shed the blood of those who shed our martyrs’ blood and you have cleansed Egypt of the traitors who collaborate with Israel and America. Do not withdraw until you have cleansed Egypt of the Shuwaysh ‘Attiyyas and their supporters, who protect the killers and criminals. Do not withdraw until you have eliminated the Egyptian judiciary, which protects the criminals and killers and lets off without punishment. The first and last word must now always lie with the people. And now, having reached the end of my words, I demand that Tahrir Square form a transitional council composed of free, honorable revolutionaries and intellectuals to run the country’s affairs, because the people must have the first and last words. The regime should serve the people, because it collects its wages from the blood of the people. Al-Shuwaysh ‘Attiyya was appointed to protect the people, and he was collecting wages off of this, and they continue to take the people’s money. But now, those belonging to the regime have lost their legitimacy, because the people and the revolution are the first and the last legitimizers. Before this conclusion of mine, thugs were hired by policemen and Central Security officers.

The Islamic Movement to Enforce Shari’a,2011-10-18,2011,",The Islamic Movement to Enforce Shari’a,“Judgment belongs only to God. He has ordered you to serve Him alone.” (Joseph, 39),,,Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, the Merciful, the Compassionate, God of the messengers, who revealed the Qur’an to the heart of His prophet so he could warn the universes, Master of the Day of Judgment. Praise be to Him in the beginning and the hereafter, His is the Authority and to Him all return. Prayer upon the best who was sent and performed his duty, who was informed and fulfilled his message, and whom the polytheists tempted in renouncing his religion but he refused. May the prayers of God and His peace be upon him. May He accept this and be satisfied.,,My brothers in God:,In the past few days, God has shown us a sign and a miracle to amaze the mind, which is none other than the fall of the blood-thirsty tyrant Mubarak and his fascist regime, which happened thanks to the grace of God. Yes, by God, everyone’s slogan the day the dictator fell was “God alone toppled the regime”. God alone brought down the regime because He alone is the Sovereign, the Omnipotent, the Creator. He has the divine names and the sublime attributes. There is no discrepancy in this. For if you ask any man today, “Who is the Creator, the Sustainer, the Overseer, the Kind, the Merciful?” He could not find any answer save “God”. If God is the Creator, then why do we not submit to him?! Why do we not obey his command?! Why do we submit ourselves to a rule other than His law?! Why do some think that His law is not appropriate in this time?,,Why.…. when He, may he be exalted, has said, “Does he not know that who creates is the Gentle, the Knower…” … You admit, brother, that God is the Creator this requires you to turn to Him in all of your life’s matters. God is the ideal.… If you had bought a certain machine and you wanted to treat it in the best possible way, would you not go back to its maker to question him? Are you not interested in his advice and guidance? This is in regards to a small machine.…How then, having confessed that God is your Creator and the Creator of everything around you, do you not return to Him and submit to His command in order to better your life as he has bettered the existence around you. Do you go to another god, asking him and submitting to him! We have seen how the man-made laws have destroyed our lives and forced us to live in humiliation and shame many years, because those laws were the making of humanity, whose nature is weak and greedy and treacherous.,,My brothers in God:,We must return now to our God and submit to His law for the nation will not feel safe and secure except through the law of the Merciful, just as Abraham, peace be upon him, said to his nation “Which of these two groups is more deserving of security, if you know?” Then he answered them, “Those who were faithful and did not cover their belief in oppression. They are safe and are the rightly guided.” Here, oppression refers to polytheism. It’s necessary to believe completely in God, which is not adulterated with polytheism, so that safety and security can be attained for us… In the Shari’a law a woman enters hell on account of imprisoning a cat, so how can security not be secured for the human race?! Also, Shariah law prevents the burning of ant hills, how can security not be secured for the human race?! This is our law—safety and security and peace and soundness—so how can we disregard it?,,My brothers in God:,Reflect with me on these verses and learn them. Go back to the commentaries in order to understand their meaning: God the Exalted said, “Is it the judgement of the age of ignorance that they are seeking? Who is better than God in judgment for a people who are so sure?” (The Table, 50).,,Who is better than God? Is there someone who thinks he is better than God at ruling? Praise God and bless His names.,,God the exalted said, “If you quarrel with one another about anything, refer it to God and the messenger, if you believe in God and the Last Day. That is better and fairer as a course.” (Women, 59),,The best, the very best is that we refer to God in all matters.,,My brothers in God:,God the most High has ordered to rule with his Shari’a, and required it for his worshippers. He made it the ultimate purpose of revealing the Qur’an. He said praise be to him: “He sent down with them the Scripture with the truth, to give decisions bteween the people about that on which they differed” (The Cow, 213). He, may he be exalted, also said: “We have sent down to you the Scripture with the truthy, for you to judge between the people, by that which God has shown you” (Women, 105).,,He, the Almighty, explained his uniqueness, and he is singular in his judgement. He said, “The decision is only with God. He recounts the truth. He is the best of expounders” (Livestock, 57). He also said, “Judgement belongs only to God. He has ordered you to serve Him alone” (Joseph, 40). God, the mighty and blessed, said, “Praise belongs to Him in the first world and the next. His is the judgement, and to Him you will be returned” (The Story, 70). He also says, “Whatever you differ about, judgement on it belongs to God.” (Counsel, 10).,,The Islamic Movement to Enforce Shari’a,[e-mail redacted],,",Religion,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155818im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitled15.png,imgID407,
The People Decided to Overthrow the Regime,2011-10-17,2011,"The People Decided to Overthrow the Regime,It has been seven months since the first wave of the revolution was victorious in taking off the head of the regime, Hosni Mubarak, and the revolution has still not achieved its goals for which it came out and for which the blood of martyrs and comrades was shed. But, rather, the opposite, the counter-revolution organized its ranks during this period in which the Islamists powers and the military council played a role in distorting the revolutionary powers. The revolutionary powers see that the revolution has not ended and will not end until it’s goals are realized.,The regime, the same one that ruled in Mubarak’s era, is still biased toward the capitalist class that sucks the blood of the current poor. They hold on to billions of dollars to support the rich while reducing the support for the poor and escaping from the minimum and maximum in wages and pensions. Freedoms are still on the guillotine of military trials.,We, in the Youth Socialist Union, consider the military council and the government of ‘Isam Sharaf nothing but a continuation of Mubarak’s regime. We emphasize the necessity of gathering everyone around the slogan of the revolution: “The people want the overthrow of the government.” We are certain that we decided to overthrow this regime with all its symbols and all of its economic and social biases.,We emphasize that we will not accept half a revolution that does not give to Egypt’s poor their social, economic, and political rights and does not include a fair distribution of wealth nor a real democracy with its social split, not simply a democracy of the market. We will not accept a revolution whose constitution does not protect all classes of people, does not make available work opportunities for its youth, and does not give independence to its judiciary power. We will not accept a revolution that imposes distorted election laws and does not give Egyptians living abroad the right to vote. We will not accept a revolution that turns revolutionaries over to the military courts and criminals over to the civilian courts.

The Basic Precepts of the Constitution,2011-10-11,2011,"[front cover],Cairo Center for the Study of Human Rights,,Freedom. . .Dignity. . .Social justice:,,The Basic Precepts of the Constitution,,“A Papyrus”,Egyptian Organizations for Human Rights,,[page 2],What is this Papyrus for?,,These proposed principles aim to contribute to overseeing human rights in the ongoing societal dialogue about the constitution of “25 January Revolution.” Specifically, they aim to crystallize guarantees of protecting what is referred to in this dialogue as the “secular state” or the “secular nature of the state,” as inspired by the values of the January 25 Revolution.,,The initiative to issue this “Papyrus” does not stem from refuting, belittling, or opposing the values of other initiatives that have already been issued or that are currently being prepared. Rather, some of those participating in preparing this “Papyrus” contributed to developing and discussing the document that was released by the probable presidential candidate Mohamed El-Baradei. They agree with its general plan regarding human rights. From a legal perspective, however, issuing similar proposals from multiple political viewpoints does not take away from the importance of the proposed document.,,The “Papyrus” aspired to be concise and concentrated so that it would not become a condensed version of the constitution. Consequently, it avoids detailing the human rights guarantees which ought to be included in the constitution, because their proper place is the constitution. It was sufficient to put a higher guarantee for these rights, which is that at minimum all of the rights and assurances which are guaranteed in international human rights charters and international law by guaranteed. These documents ought to form the principle reference for detailing these rights in the constitution and legislation.,,The “Papyrus” does not endorse a specific system of governance (parliamentary, presidential, or hybrid); instead, it also leaves this matter to the constitution. It limited itself to a group of high constitutional principles that one must be committed to in any democratic system, regardless of the system the constitution adopts.,,Likewise, the “Papyrus” avoids presenting a specific drafting of what has come to be known as the “second article of the constitution”, which relates to the sources of legislation, as the constitution is the appropriate place for this. It limited itself to emphasizing the need for multiple sources of legislation, as a super-constitutional principle that reflects the diversity of the Egyptian citizens’ religions, sects, races, and cultures. This is now the place for societal harmony. Elements of Islamist groups should be included, even if the discussants disagree about the appropriate form for shaping these multiple sources of legislation.,,It is not enough for the “Papyrus” to strive to defend these lofty constitutional principles against attacks against them for whatever superficially “democratic” pretext is championed by a given majority. Instead, it suggests forming a constitutional committee to undertake this mission. After the stabilization of a democratic system in Egypt, perhaps sometime over the next two decades, Egypt will not need the likes of this forced guarantee.,,[page 3],A Papyrus of the Basic Principles in the Constitution,,Article 1,,Egypt is a nation of multiple religions, sects, creeds, races, and cultures. This unique diversity formed the mentality of Egyptians and their identity, and the creative interactions among these components throughout history—and also among the Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, Coptic, and Arab-Islamic civilizations. It is a source of pride and respect of all Egyptians, and a cornerstone of their sacred national unity. The sole Egyptian identity is the variety of civilizational dimensions, components, and roots. This plurality is the greatest source of the richness and uniqueness of the Egyptian character. It is impossible, historically and practically, to condense this identity into one dimension without destroying the national unity of Egyptians or losing the country’s independence.,,The constitution guarantees the plurality of legislative sources, in which the diverse sources of the Egyptian identity are reflected. The constitution helps to fortify national unity. The constitution also neither helps to impose legislation that regiments the private lives of Egyptians in such a manner as to contradict with their beliefs, nor does it help regiment the private or public sphere in a manner contrary to the guarantees of human rights and general freedoms.,,The constitution protects each Egyptian’s right to enjoy their cultural rights, as is also required for the preservation of the national heritage, and the constitution protects the diverse cultures of racial, religious, and geographical groups present throughout Egyptian history.,,Article 2,,,[page 4],,,[page 5],,Article 3,,The police force is an official and civil body—not a military one—and it undertakes the task of protecting domestic security and the general order. The Interior Ministry submits to the oversight of the elected representative bodies which are appointed by political figures.,,Article 4,,The state alone establishes the armed forces, and it is not permitted under any pretext for any group to establish a military or militaristic organization. The armed forces assume the defense of the independence and peace of the nation against military dangers.,The president of the republic is the supreme leader of the armed forces, and the defense minister submits to overseeing the elected representative bodies.,,Article 5,,All Egyptians, both male and female, have the right to enjoy the rights and guarantees that appear in this “Papyrus” without any discrimination. An aggression against any of these rights constitutes a crime. This “Papyrus” does not contain any text that could in some sense be open to interpretation and whose distortion could benefit granting any state institutions, groups, or individuals the right to engage in any activity or act that aims to violate any rights, freedoms, or guarantees stipulated in this “Papyrus.”,,As soon as this text is endorsed, it becomes a binding text for any constitutive body that is formed by the new constitution. It is not permitted to amend any of this text prior to twenty years subsequent to its endorsement, even if this were to be approved by a parliamentary majority or a new constitutive body. The parliament is tasked with ensuring the consistency between the rules of this documents and all current laws, either by amending the laws or replacing them.,,Article 6,,A constitutional committee is formed, and it adopts the mission of protecting the constitution and the democratic system, in particular, guaranteeing the implementation of Article 5 of this “Papyrus.” This committee should be composed of heads of the supreme courts,1 under the leadership of the chief of the supreme committee of the judiciary, and its decisions are binding for all powers.,,The members of parliament and political parties and human rights organizations, civil society organizations, and specific national human rights organizations have the right to proceed directly to the constitutional committee for constitutional motives or due to any complaints related to its mission.,,[back cover],The Signatory Organizations:,,We welcome your opinions and suggestions via electronic mail:,[e-mail redacted],","Constitution, Theory",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141407im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitled8.png,imgID414,

Moreover, hindering the revolution and taking measures opposing its goals are leading to the return of remnants from National Democratic Party, and paving the way for forces waiting to reap the fruits of the revolution at the expense of the blood of the martyrs and the masses, including the youth, the laboring workers, the farmers, and the poor.,,Therefore our party affirms the urgent and necessary demands of the people to put the revolution back on track:,,,The Egyptian Communist Party urges all of the poor – the laborers, the workers, the farmers, and especially those who have public pensions – to stand together and demand the most important of the revolution’s demands: the achievement of social justice for every citizen.

We Were Born From the Womb of the Revolution,2011-10-09,2011,"[Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance, Foundation Issue, Page 4],We Were Born From the Womb of the Revolution,,On 25 January 2011, the Egyptian youth began a noble revolution that formed a turning point in our history and, indeed, in the history of the world. Over the course of several days, the youth’s spark expanded and transformed into an overwhelming popular revolution in which millions of the Egyptian people’s sons and daughters participated alongside its proletarian masses, granting it a massive momentum and the energy of a struggle that grew even stronger thanks to the youths at its forefront. The revolution succeeded in getting rid of the dictator Mubarak and many of those around him who monopolized power and riches and made corruption and tyranny a matter of course. In this, the revolution inaugurated the birth of a new nation and took the first steps in a long journey towards exacting all of the masses’ political and social demands.,,The revolution exploded against a background of general, overwhelming feelings of social injustice due to economic policies biased toward the rich and the astronomical riches created by a gang of corrupt and tyrannical individuals from the blood of the people by starving them, impoverishing them, and exploiting them. While millions of Egyptians live in slums, sleep on sidewalks, and suffer from hunger and nakedness, mansions and resorts continue to be built for which no residents can be found, and markets overflow with tons of food and clothing for which no consumers can be found. All of this is in addition to the collapse of educational and public health services, the stealing of pension money, and the reduction of all social safety nets.,,The people wanted to topple the regime that hijacked the national economy so that the sectors of tourism, trade, and luxury real estate would control it, while agriculture and production deteriorated. It reach a point where this economy could no longer provide employment opportunities, which forced millions of youths into the abyss of unemployment, and even caused some to risk death in illegal emigration boats, fleeing an inhuman life.,,Under these policies, culture and art were turned into commodities controlled by a mafia of traders and the rules of the market, or else they were besieged by systems of bureaucratic management. The result has been a distortion of consciousness and existence. Culture, the arts, and all areas of creative production deteriorated, and the path was blocked for innovators and creators, who unearthed boulders to let some of their creations see the light.,,The revolution also succeeded in burying the criminal attempts of Mubarak’s regime to ignite sectarian strife among the people’s ranks, along with attempts to isolate Christians from political action. It also succeeded in transforming the slogan “Religion is for God, and the state is for everyone” from mere words into a living, tangible reality throughout the days of the strike in Tahrir Square. Just as the peaceful, struggle-based nature of the revolution and the climate of national brotherhood that permeated it led the peoples of the world to stand with our revolution. It thus became an inspiring example to all the peoples that are struggling for democracy and social justice.,,And from the heart of the revolution the face of Fighting Egypt appeared to remove from its burdened back the dust of years of inaction. Huge brigades of new fighters came out into the light, raising slogans of struggle for the sake of democracy and justice. And in the heart of the revolution, the currents of thought and forces of the Egyptian Left and those struggling for socialism were equal among the people, without any discrimination, power grabbing, monopolizing, or exclusion. They worked side by side with the rest of the democratic- and youth-driven forces, and with all the organizations for change, to bring the revolution to victory. The will to change displayed by the youths struggling for freedom and social justice met with the powers of the Egyptian Left, which represents one of the largest branches of our people’s heritage of struggle, for the sake of liberation, democracy, and social justice.,,The “Popular Alliance” party is born from the womb of the revolution. It broadens to include all the powers of progressive, leftist, and socialist democracy that struggle together towards the slogans that the revolution embraced: “Change, freedom, social justice, and human dignity.”,,The party begins with numerous important positions that reflect the demands of the 25 January Revolution’s masses.,,First: We insist upon the realization of all the demands related to democracy and political reform, and we will not be disparaged from this. These demands include the necessity of distancing all the pillars of the old regime from power and transferring power to a temporary, civil government. They also include dissolving the local councils; revoking Emergency Law, exceptional trials, and laws restricting freedoms; releasing all prisoners; and bringing the symbols of corruption and tyranny to trial. They furthermore include drafting a new constitution that confirms the principle of the separation of powers; ends the domination of the executive authority over the legislative and judicial authorities; subjects the security institutions to popular civilian oversight; affirms the independence of the judiciary and the merits for Egypt of a true parliament that enjoys the powers of oversight and lawmaking; and nullifies all restrictions on establishing political parties, unions, and associations, and publishing newspapers.,,Second: We demand that political change be linked with social change in one framework, fulfilling human rights, redirecting the economy, and putting in place a plan for growth that will benefit the poor masses in Egypt, among them workers, farmers, employees, marginalized groups, small-business owners, and artisans. Their rights to food, shelter, education, work, fair wages, and health care must be guaranteed. Economic and social exploitation, together with the hegemony of monopolies, must be confronted. Minimum and maximum wages must be set, salaries must correspond to market prices, and unemployment subsidies must be paid. Overdue loans to small-time farmers and artisans must be cancelled, and public spending must be directed toward the improvement of public services. Progressive taxes must be placed on the wealthy, and radical agricultural reform must be realized.,,Third: All forms of subordination to Zionism and colonial governments must be opposed. This includes resistance to normalization with Israel, supporting instead the Arab people and all peoples in the world who struggle for the sake of democracy and liberation, and supporting in particular the Palestinian people’s struggle to achieve their freedom and establish a state. This also includes support for all forms of resistance to colonialism, among them armed resistance, with the exception of violent actions directed solely against civilians.,,Fourth: We support the struggle for a civil state—not a religious one, and not a military one. We also demand the separation of religion from politics, and oppose all forms of discrimination on the basis of religion, gender, color, political conviction, or social position. We support the struggle for freedom of thought, expression, creation, and scholarly research.,,The “Popular Alliance” party is a party opposed to capitalist exploitation, capitalist hegemony, and monopolies. It supports the interest of the poor and the producers. It persistently seeks to call upon all workers, farmers, employees, and all the impoverished masses to join its ranks, together with the youths who reject corruption, tyranny, and exploitation, and all intellectuals and creative minds who favor democracy and justice—from different social classes and sects.

Moreover, this is about to lead to the restoration of the old regime, which the revolution sought to root out.,,The military council is trying revolutionaries and civilians in military courts, and is returning police brutality to the Egyptian squares. At the same time that remnants of the former regime are involving themselves in the demonstrations and raise pictures and banners of the deposed president outside and inside of his trial. The military council has also continued passing laws and legislation contrary to what the parties, political forces, and the revolution’s youth coalition had previously agreed. Indeed, the policies and decisions of the military council and the government have practically torn apart the goals and demands of the revolution.,,Therefore, the National Progressive Unionist Party is deciding to adhere to the goals of the revolution and the shared struggle along with the forces of the revolution in order to achieve all of its goals. We declare our firm intention to achieve the following:,,,The first of the demands pertaining to social justice, which requires immediate heeding and execution, is putting in place a minimum wage and a maximum wage, and passing legislation based on the principle of progressive taxation.,,Glory and eternity to the righteous martyrs of the revolution,And long live Egypt as a nation for freedom, socialism and unity,,,National Progressive Unionist Party,“Tahrir Square”,Released on 9/9/2011,","Politics, The National Progressive Unionist Party (Hizb al-Tagammu')",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151857im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitled5.png,imgID418,
We Want a Humane State Based on both Reason and Religion,2011-10-06,2011,",We want….a humane state,Based on both…reason and religion,,Do Egyptians want to build a secular state?….Or a civilian state with an Islamic reference point? Can either of these two states present a solution to the problems of Egyptian society in particular?,,God Almighty created the human of body and mind, and He honored him with reason that he might become a will with complete freedom of choice. All the heavenly prophets came with one mission: to liberate reason from oppression and ignorance that man might know God and worship him to the fullest, and that he might take up the responsibility of bringing growth and prosperity to the earth in order to become worthy of being the caliph of God on earth.,,Though states throughout the past century may have called themselves Islamic or [claimed] that they applied Islam, they utterly failed to present a model that could solve the problems of society, despite the immense wealth which God endowed upon these states. This was because they cut Islam out of all their slogans, leading to subordination, dependence, defeat, ignorance, and a failure to present society with what it required and was appropriate to its conditions. They also did not possess plans or scientific programs to solve society’s problems.,,Likewise, the secular states in the West have also completely failed in all areas (bankruptcy and financial crisis – wars, destruction, and killing – control, hegemony, and occupation of states – a complete collapse of social systems – homosexual marriage – allowing abortion – legalization of taking drugs – the emergence of an economy of parasites and the collapse of social classes in the interests of savage capitalism – an increase in the percentage of marginalized people and an increase in the poverty rate in secular Latin American states – the highest rate of depression and suicide in the world). Indeed, religious principles were transformed into worldly concepts, presented, and considered to be a worldly religion, based on reason and science instead of divine religion. It reached a point where the English cardinal Kirk Mary said that the religious reality which secularism had produced led to the near-collapse of Christianity itself, and to religion no longer being influential in people’s lives. But at the same time, it is not possible to deny that secularism is linked to the use of reason and ways of thinking about the world, more so than what religious forces and their spokesmen practice, and it represents amazing scientific advancement in all areas.,,For more than 600 years ago, the largest humane civilization that history has ever known spread from Nalshik, south Russia to Toledo, northwest Portugal—a civilization based on the values of dialogue between spirit, body, and reason together. Numerous ethnic groups and nationalities lived in it. Likewise, Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Pagans all coexisted together, and non-Muslims in Andalusia reached the degree of first minister. The civilization was based on the principles of freedom, justice, equality, and acceptance of others more than 1,400 years before the West knew these [principles]. Without raising a single slogan, they gave freedom to these nations, allowed them the right to choose, took up the reasons of life, and produced glory, history and a humane civilization.,,We are calling for a humane state based on both reason and religion together. As the Prophet of God, peace be upon him, said: “I left for you that which, if you hold to it, you will never be misguided: the book of God and my Sunnah (religion), so they understood and comprehended, oh people of intellect (reason).” Likewise, the Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali says: “Reason and religion are like the eye and the sun: they do not function except together. Is it reasonable for one to set out closing the eyelids of his eyes, satisfied with the light of the sun, and is it reasonable for one to set out denying the light of the sun, satisfied with the light of his eye?”,,Ingredients for the success of revolutions,,1. The greatest of revolutions are those that the messengers and the prophets brought. All of them were based on a clear vision, radical change in thinking and reason, and gradual change when these things are implemented in society.,,2. The recognition that the current crisis is a crisis in society as a whole and not only a regime crisis.,,3. The 25 January Revolution is the revolution of all the Egyptian people, whether they went out into the streets or not, and it is even the revolution of those who died before the revolution. Has anyone forgotten all that both the deceased Magdi Mihna and Dr. ‘Abd al-Wahab al-Masiri gave in confronting the previous regime? Subsequently, it is not possible for the revolution to be cut up into coalitions, parties, and political forces. The number of those who took to the streets during the revolution was around 18 million in all of Egypt, and these did not allow for any one person to speak in their name, no matter his role, as no one has a guardianship over the people.,,4. The most important results of the revolution have been the people’s wresting their rights away from the governing authority and establishing the constitution as a social contract agreed upon by all Egyptians on January 28. It became present in their hearts and minds, and it is now impossible for any other authority, no matter what, to return the people back to what was prior to this day.,,5. The regime is not merely a group of officials; it is also a series policies, systems, programs, laws, statues, customs, and behaviors. Because we are still in a revolutionary stage, the transitional period that will begin after legitimate elections are held will be an interval in Egypt’s history, and political forces must be prepared for a complete examination of all this.,,6. The best political system for Egypt is the mixed system because it strives to increase the legitimacy of the political system by dividing up legitimacy between both the parliament and the president.,,7. In pre-state conditions or in the condition of lacking a state, four main powers contend to lead and direct society, and if we aim to rebuild the state these powers must accept the following:,,(The Armed Forces accept the authority of civilian government – financial and wealthy forces accept the fair distribution of this wealth – religious forces and their spokesmen consent to use reason and science alongside religion – the forces of protestors and demonstrators in the streets accept to put representatives in a position to carry responsibility),,8. The mechanism to realize the goals of the revolution must be represented in the interests and governing institutions, which must undertake this realization. Because the previous regime transformed them into estates for the owners that directed them, the central demand now is that state institutions be swiftly built/or rebuilt. For this reason, the “Initiative to Build the Egypt of the Future” strives to help realize the goals of the revolution by enabling the generations of revolutionary-thinking youth to build/or rebuild the institutional capabilities of the political, economic, and social systems of the state.,,9. There is no so-called civilian state; there is only civilian government.,,10. No political forces can claim that there is an ideal solution for the problems of life; there isn’t one. Therefore, the consensus based on taking the good from all the elements of society is the closest to correct.,,11. The mixed, electoral regime that was decided upon is the most appropriate for the transitional period and therefore for the stability of the whole society. However, it will be possible to take up a party-list system completely after this stage.,,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163821im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitled4.png,imgID419,

The area of Imbaba witnessed this last Saturday, 7 May, and it led to the death of at least 12 citizens and the injury of more than 220. Attacks have extended to private and public property, to say nothing of the partial destruction of the Marmina Church and the complete burning of the Church of the Virgin.,,The signatories of the statement believe that those in charge of the administration of the country’s affairs, whether in the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces or the Parliament, have taken the same approach as the previous regime. They have been reluctant to uphold their responsibility in employing the principle of the rule of law, protecting citizen’s lives, insuring guarantees of respecting the freedom of religion, deepening the values of equality, and eliminating fanaticism and religious extremism. They have given up judicious implementation of the law and employing the standards of justice and pretended not to notice the rise of the incitement of religions hatred and sectarian violence. Likewise, they proceed to let off without punishment or accountability the crimes of sectarian violence that exploded in a number of governorates during the last three months.,,The signatories of the statement place direct responsibility on the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the Parliament for the non-implementation of the law and not dealing resolutely with all whom incite or target with words or actions places of worship and citizens on a religious or sectarian basis.

The People that Make only Half a Revolution Dig their own Grave,2011-10-03,2011,"The people that make only half a revolution dig their own grave,,Friday, 9 September: The Friday of Putting the Revolution Back on Track,,Once again we are returning to the square. We are completing our revolution, which is still in its infancy. We are completing the journey we began together, the journey from which we shall not stray until all of the masses’ goals regarding freedom, dignity, and social justice have been achieved.,,We started on 25 January, and we didn’t expect to succeed. We shattered the barriers of fear and frustration. We occupied the streets, and Tahrir Square became our epicenter. We warned the regime on the “Friday of Rage” and kept our promise, and that was the beginning of the regime’s fall…We demonstrated in Tahrir Square for eighteen days. We didn’t give up, and we weren’t shaken by the regime’s painful beatings. We all stuck together, facing death, and struggled until the end. We were victorious, and the deposed ruler fell. We celebrated our clear victory together.,,We were not content to merely overthrow the head of the regime, so we continued our revolutionary movement with a view towards achieving the legitimate demands on which our great people had agreed. And every time we occupied Tahrir Square and the large squares in the provinces, we were seizing a new victory that would push our Egypt towards freedom, democracy, and social justice.,,Now, seven months after the fall of the head, the body still moves. The remnants of the dissolved party – which was not politically isolated until now – are gathering their fragments to compete in the parliamentary elections. The youth of the revolution, who were unjustly and slanderously targeted by the armed thugs, continue to be tried in military courts. Our judiciary is still not independent, and it still does not enjoy immunity. We still seek to pass a minimum and maximum wage law, in order to realize social justice, which is absent from our society. Instead, unjust laws have appeared: those banning strikes, demonstrations, the People’s Assembly and Shura Council law, as well as the electoral law. The Interior Ministry still acts with the same violent, security-based mentality and does not realize that we have been in a state of revolution. The media is still in need of purging. The Foreign Ministry still treats Israel as though it were a strategic ally, lying down helplessly before it instead of facing it head to head.,,The revolution is in its beginning, and it will only be completed with your help. Join us in the “Friday of Putting the Revolution Back on Track” on 9 September so we can complete our journey towards a free, just, and democratic Egypt. And don’t forget: only half of a revolution means a graveyard for the people.,,Youth for Justice and Freedom,Member of the Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution,[phone #'s redacted],","Calls to Protest, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163827im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitled1.png,imgID422,
Freedom and a Bite to Eat,2011-10-02,2011,"[page 1],,Freedom and a Bite to Eat,,The People Want,,A Fair Budget,,,,The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance,,[page 2],,What’s it mean?,,The Budget,,A plan the government makes each year, saying where it’ll get its money from and where it’ll go.,,The Government Favoring the Poor:,,That’s a government that makes a budget that gets money from the rich and distributes it to the poor.,,The Government Favoring the Rich:,,That’s a government that makes a budget that gets money from the poor and distributes it to support the companies and factories of the rich.,,Progressive Taxation:,,A type of taxation where the rich classes pay more taxes. So if someone earns 12 thousand EGP in a year, he pays 10%, but if another person earns 100 thousand EGP in a year, he pays 25%, and if he earns 10 million in a year, he pays 30%, and so on.,,The International Monetary Fund,,An international financial organization that gives out loans to nations in exchange for meeting specific conditions. These conditions serve the interests of large nations but come at the expense of poor nations that scrape together money.,,Austerity,,This is a policy for making the budget when the government has become poor and wants to reduce the money that it distributes, so it abolishes some unnecessary expenses.,,[page 3],,Ok, What’s Up with the Budget of the Current Government?,,Where’s the Current Budget Get Money from?,,Like Mubarak’s government, most resources for the budget come from the people’s pocket, the Suez Canal, petrol, the taxes which the public sector or employees pay, and the sales tax that the citizen pays while there’s a little bit of participation from the private sector. That’s other than loans from the national bank, which wants us to sell the rest of the assets that the state owns or give them to creditors. So it’s a government that does business which jeopardizes the country. Whatever type of government comes next, it’s bound to the rulings of the Monetary Fund.,,Ok, so What is Contained within the Budget?,,A little bit of it goes to education, healthcare, and other types of social services. At the same time, it supports the businessmen out of our pockets in the form of support for exports, gas, and electricity for cement, ceramic, fertilizer, and iron factories that pollute the environment and monopolize the Egyptian market.. So a little bit is for the poor and a decent amount is for the rich.,,[page 4],,Ok, so There’s no Improvement over the Previous Regime?,,To tell the truth, no. The percentage for education has gone down from 11.4% to 10.5%, healthcare from 4.9% to 4.8%. However, if we compare these numbers with any advanced nations—even the capitalist nations—we’ll see the difference. 18% of the federal expenditure in America goes to healthcare!,,Shouldn’t the Government Distribute Money to Itself from the Budget?,,Naturally… but where’s the money coming from? The salaries of the Interior Ministry and expenditures of public security, receptions, celebrations, official travel, adviser bonuses—all that—is from the budget and it’s strange that these things haven’t decreased from Mubarak’s era! Mubarak had one million two hundred thousand Central Security soldiers as well the security forces that arrested and tortured us. So now that Mubarak is gone why does the government of the revolution spend on the Interior Ministry? 22.7 billion in the new budget.,,Ok, what’s the Solution to this Budget?,,The solution is that we balance the scale and the rich take on the largest part in financing the budget while the poor benefit by way of education, healthcare, and support for their daily bread with budget revenues.,,How?,,We impose progressive taxation on income and profits and taxes on speculation in the stock market and land trading. We delineate a wage ceiling on income for workers in the state, without bonuses and special allowances, and the government decreases entertainment expenditures for receptions, travel, cars, etc. The government could invest part of the budget in strategic plans of the State Treasury or bringing back the companies that were privatized for dirt cheap.,,[page 5],,So these Progressive Taxes, Don’t they Hurt the Economy?,,Fact of the matter is that’s a big lie. Providing better education and healthcare helps the citizen be more productive, resulting in a better economy over the long term. Really, we haven’t been very rational about the subject. Most capitalist nations have this type of system. In America, 35%. In England, 40% and Australia 45%. We’ve got 25% as the upper limit in Egypt.,,Ok, but Won’t the Government Become Weak if it Applies Austerity Measures?,,When the government applied austerity measures Mubarak’s way, they decreased education, healthcare, and pensions because they wouldn’t take out loans while protecting the budget of the Interior Ministry and not changing the salaries of the elites. On top of that, 2.5 billion went to the support of exports that would go to the private sector. It wasn’t education and healthcare first like that. These austerity measures were at the expense of the poor and the money went to the pockets of the rich.,,The first thing we should be able to get from the revolution is a revolutionary budget, redistributing the people’s wealth in the interest the poor.,,[page 6],,The revolution won’t really be complete,except with freedom and a bite to eat together,,without anybody on his lonesome.,,Contact us:,,The Party,of the Popular Socialist Alliance,,Main,Headquarters: 71 Nubar St. – Bab al-Luq – 1st Floor,T: [telephone #'s redacted],Cairo: The Waqfs Building in front of the neighborhood Hada’iq al-Qubba,Block 5 – Apartment 6,Alexandria: 89 Memphis St. – Ibrihamiyya – 1st Floor,Apartment 8,Isma’iliyya: 96 al-Thulathini St. – 1st Floor,al-Daqaliyya: 5 Salah Salim St. – Khafagi Tower – 6th Floor,,Website http://egyleftparty.org,The page on Facebook is called “al-Tahaluf al-Sha’bi” [The Popular Alliance],www.facebook.com/popular.alliance.party,","Politics, The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151733im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/untitled.png,imgID423,

We are also interested in agricultural development, achieving national self-sufficiency, making advances in the agricultural sphere, and expanding the wealth of animal and marine life. Finally, we believe in the benefits of technological progress and encourage investment in scientific devices that will ensure Egypt’s well-being, protect her territory, and its nationalized companies.,,[page 3],,The founders believe that adequate and systematic, efficient services are integral to the country’s economic progress. They believe it is necessary to establish a long-term plan for desirable reforms in every field and to benefit from the experience of excellent, friendly nations by sending out foreign missions to fill in the experience gap through long-distance education.,,They also believe in the necessity of establishing an appropriate minimum wage and an appropriate wage ceiling so that justice and personal well-being can be ensured. These limits should be linked to inflation indices, and all kinds of corruption—along with faulty distribution of wealth—should come to an end. The map for economic renewal should be distributed to all parts of the country, and charitable as well as religious institutions should be initiated. The country’s sons should cooperate with the wealthy to found economic institutions which contribute to social integration.,,They also believe in establishing foreign relations with other countries and people based on mutual respect and equitable relationships, peaceful coexistence, and good neighborliness free of aggression. Global and regional issues should be resolved by negotiations, not armed conflict. Treaties and charters that have already been agreed upon should be respected. The country should not be thrown into regional strife or global alliances that do not protect national interests or the people’s rebirth.,[page 4],,They believe in securing all family members’ rights as vouched for by Islamic tenets and the right of young people to feel sovereignty and a sense of belonging to their country. These youths’ colossal capabilities should be transformed into constructive ones that will make Egypt a pioneering country—one that guarantees freedom of thought, expression, work, healthcare, and a dignified life.,,They support the Egyptian army and believe in strengthening it both doctrinally and militarily so that it can always be ready to defend Egypt’s safety. They also believe in intellectual, credence-based, and practical guidance for the security apparatus for the good of the country and its sons. Finally, they are concerned with combating the embezzlement of public funds, terrorism, ideological extremism, addictions, transit accidents, and treating security problems in an intelligent way based on collaborative scholarly efforts.,,Together we are building Egypt So that tomorrow will be better,Southern Cairo Secretariat,[phone numbers redacted],www.alnourparty.org,The symbol of the Nur Party’s listings in the Parliamentary Elections is the (lamp),,","Other Parties, Politics",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152004im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled20.png,imgID427,

Members of the People’s Assembly:,The People’s Assembly represents legitimate authority, and its members represent different sectors of the population. They monitor and observe the president, the government (ministers and governors), and all government apparatuses. They hold them accountable and form committees to monitor them. They approve drafted legislation, amend the constitution, put forward and discuss projects and important decisions, and discuss the state budget.,(Members of the People’s Assembly are not public servants; they have been nominated to speak in the name of the people and the entire state regarding public, state-related issues. As for members of local councils, they are spokespeople for the neighborhood residents and their problems and are charged with resolving issues pertaining to the districts that nominated them. They are also charged with investigating violations committed by officials and public services connected to the ministries on the neighborhood level.),,* Immunity:,Council members are granted the capacity of observing and overseeing the work of government agencies such as departments and ministries, and they have the right to condemn these agencies in the event of an error. They also have the right to put any minister to questioning through the council. This immunity prevents agencies and officials from exploiting their authority by directly or indirectly disrupting or preventing council members from exercising their powers. “It is not an immunity to be exploited for personal interests.”,,(Members of the People’s Assembly should not be elected to serve you personally or because they are close to you… elect a person who is aware of the laws and the true problems of the state, domestic and foreign, and who is able to confront the government.),,-2-,Every candidate, whether independent or linked to a party, must announce his election platform.,,*The parties:,The party is a congregation of more than one individual in agreement on shared backgrounds, be they political, religious, social, or otherwise.

It aims to delineate the features of the state and outline how the policies and projects it advances—all of which are well studied and made public—will improve the state.,The party puts pressure on the government to give priority to an issue or make a decision through the party members represented in the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council. Therefore, the party strives for the success of its candidates in these bodies.,,If you want to join a party, you must be convinced of the party’s principles and policies.

Let us Return to the Squares to Complete our Revolution,2011-11-26,2011,",Let us Return to the Squares to Complete our Revolution,The revolution has returned to all of Egypt’s squares and streets yet again to complete its course. The masses are once again pouring into the squares to announce that the only legitimacy is that of the revolution and the people in the heart of the squares. They affirm the masses’ distrust and refusal of the Military Council and its government. They refuse a Military Council that intentionally hindered the transitional period and impeded the revolution’s course to change and cleansing. They refuse a government that lacks power and is nothing but a secretary to the Military Council. They refuse a government that does not possess the will or ability to complete the revolution’s course.,We, as revolutionary youth forces, insist that the current crisis cannot be solved by merely accepting the resignations of Sharaf and his government, nor can it be solved by the Military Council appointing a new government which will also lack power. These deceptive solutions have been far surpassed by the masses. Now that they have raised their main slogans against the Military Council and called for its ouster, these solutions are no longer acceptable to them. This cannot be achieved without continuing the popular pressure in all Egypt’s squares, because the people are the one guarantee for the continuation of the revolution. They are the first and last decision-makers. Thus, we call for all Egyptians to march and participate in the million-man mobilization on Wednesday, 22 November, in all Tahrir Squares across the length and breadth of Egypt, in order to achieve the following:,- A total relinquishing of political power on the part of the Military Council,- The transfer of power to a National Revolutionary Salvation Government with absolute power to direct the transitional phase—This Government will be committed to achieving Egyptians’ aspirations in the areas of security and the economy, and setting a clear time table for the transfer of power to an elected parliament and president.,- Trying all involved in assaulting civilians, from the Ministry of the Interior or the Army beginning on the 25th of June, continuing with the events at Maspero and to the massacre of November 19th and 20th.,,Where the masses are concerned, the revolution still continues.

The Guardians of the Revolution Front,2011-11-24,2011,"The Guardians of the Revolution Front,In light of what Egypt is witnessing with regard to decisions and behavior from the Military Council and the government in opposition to the blessed 25 January Revolution, such as extending the emergency law in violation of the first constitutional declaration and insisting on the adoption of the individual [candidate] system in the coming elections for the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council in violation of the wishes of all the parties and political forces of different orientations, and likewise what was seen during the trial of the ousted president Hosni Mubarak and his cronies in terms of the falsification of facts and events by changing the statements of the primary witnesses of events which threatens to change the course of the cases, squander the martyrs’ blood, and constrain the rights of the Egyptian people, along with the failure to enact the revolution’s demands or to achieve something tangible from them on the ground, the Guardians of the Revolution Front has decided to participate in the demonstrations of 30 September, calling on all sincere nationalist forces to participate in these demonstrations in all the governorates, cities, centers, and villages of Egypt.,The Front confirms that the people’s demands will not be achieved except by descending into Tahrir Square and all the squares of Egypt. It says to all those who hesitate from participating that the demands of the revolution are in danger and that remnants of the National [Democratic] Party and the lackeys of the former regime are planning a counter-revolution to abort the Egyptian people’s uprising and return Egypt to its previous corruption, injustice, subservience, and submission to America, Israel, and all the nation’s enemies.,The Front reaffirms a number of demands:,1 – Bringing the emergency law to a halt and not extending it, being content with the articles of the penal code, which are sufficient, if employed, to achieve security and stability and eliminate the thuggery and lawlessness provided that the police are serious about dealing with events and maintain a concentrated and effective presence on the streets.,2 – Basing the coming parliamentary and local elections on a 100% unconditional proportional list system and allowing independents to form lists with one another.,3 – Amending the laws of treason and the political isolation of each official, leader, member of parliament or of the Local Councils from the National [Democratic] Party over the past twenty or thirty years, according to the judicial ruling to dissolve the National [Democratic] Party for bringing about the corruption of political life in Egypt.,4 – Setting a maximum wage to provide the necessary budget to implement the minimum wage approved by the administrative court.,5 – Putting in place a timetable to place the country under elected civil authority and not extending the transitional period.,6 – Holding accountable those who destroyed evidence in the accusations against the perpetrators and murderers of martyrs during the events of the revolution, like those who participated in the crime and covered it up, making use of the video clips of events taken by revolutionaries and journalists, and holding accountable those who changed their testimony in favor of the killers and officials of the former regime.,,Long Live Free Egypt Long Live the Revolution Glory to the Martyrs,,Contact: [email redacted],Or Google the Guardians of the Revolution Front,,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141224im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled19.png,imgID435,

We decided jointly on January 25 to bring down the state of poverty, oppression, subjugation and tyranny. Despite the attempts to sidestep the demands of the Revolution, we took from Tahrir Square our support and sustenance for the demands of the nation, which wants to firmly establish the concepts of truly democratic state, a state of justice, freedom and equality. But it appears that these demands continue to face hurdles. They are trampled under the feet of those who wish to make political or authoritarian gains. These gains would turn the country back at the expense of the Revolution’s advances, successes, and the achievement of its goals. The collective consciousness of the nation has shaped these goales and the shared conscience of the country’s sons, who suffered much from tyranny, has defended them.,,Therefore we announce,,1. Our complete refusal of trying civilians in front of military courts because they disregard freedom of expression, a basic principle, and which completely violates international charters that allow the accused the right to appear before a regular judge.,,2. We absolutely refuse the new system for dividing electoral precincts, which we consider a new way of restoring the figures of the previous regime to control of legislative power through the back door.,,3.

The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution: Together for the Power of the People,2011-11-23,2011,",[Logo: The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution],The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,,18 November,Together for the Power of the People,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are participating in the demonstrations Friday, 18 November, to request the handover of power to civilian rule, thus achieving the goals of the revolution which the Egyptian people demanded. They are: social justice, freedom, and dignity. The Military Council is blocking their achievement due to their bias for their own interests which, necessarily, are contradictory to the interests of the people. The people want their daily bread, but they want to stockpile vast riches in their personal bank accounts. The people want freedom, but they cannot continue to govern without dragging thousands of our children into their prisons. The people want dignity, but they trample it into the ground a thousand times a day. This is how it is in the shadow of the Military Council’s government, which protects the remnants of Mubarak, guaranteeing them control over the next parliament. This is what has pushed us to say with confidence that the Military Council is enemy number one of the revolution, the true leader of the counter-revolution, which does not want the best for Egypt or her people. Instead, since the Military Council came to power, it has ensured the catastrophic path through which we have been led as regards the administration of the country. It is a path based on repression; military tribunals for civilians; inflaming sectarian strife between Christians and Muslims every now and then to distract the people from their principle demands; manufactured security degeneration; not putting on trial those who killed the martyrs; delay in putting the murderer Mubarak and his aides on trial; and the murder of citizens, shot with bullets and run over by armored vehicles that the Egyptians bought with their own meager incomes.,Today, the Egyptians have nothing but their unity and the organization of their ranks—creating revolutionary societies and popular committees on every street in Egypt in preparation for seizing power from the Military Council and establishing a popular revolutionary authority that gives the homeland and the citizens their dignity and their right to a free and dignified life. Some have surmised that achieving this goal is impossible. To them, we say that it is impossible to continue under the weight of an authoritarian government that has been sucking the Egyptian people’s blood for more than thirty years. It is impossible to give up on the goals of the revolution, of which the Egyptian people have dreamed for many long years. Freedom and justice are not too much for the Egyptians, for they actually can seize them from the grip of the Military Council’s tyrants who imagine themselves to be above the people and above accountability.,,Together for a Civilian Revolutionary Government,Down with Military Government,Facebook- http://www.facebook.com/legansh3bia,Mobs/ [phone #s redacted],","Calls to Protest, Revolution, The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151538im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled7.png,imgID437,

"Come, Let’s Write Our Constitution",2011-11-22,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 8, Page 2],Come, let’s write our constitution…,,We like to catch the reader’s attention from the start and say that this article is not calling for the constitution first, nor the elections first, nor is it important to us which one comes first. What is important to us is that we are a true part of the equation.….,,The general sentiment right now among many citizens is the following: it is as though they are sitting in lines of onlookers, or on the reserve bench during an important game, waiting for whoever will score the first goal. Will it be the constitution-first supporters, or elections-first supporters? Will it be the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafists, the Liberals, the Socialists, or the youth movements? The Egyptian public that once congregated around the revolution now stays away from it and has begun to watch it as if it were a strange child not even a day old. They do this even though they know the truth, which is that what happened on 25 January was for all of us citizens in whose name ‘the elite’ speaks. They fill the world with noise. Newspapers, satellite TV programs, social-networking sites—through these media they speak in our place, discussing our desires, dreams, and ambitions without ever asking one of us how we see it.,,We are speaking to you today about an important initiative to make us a true part of the equation. It is possible that this initiative can overcome the errors that the elite have made while speaking on our behalf. “Come, let’s write our constitution” is an initiative launched by a group of people interested in public action. It is an invitation to think together about the social contract we can dream up for our “new” Republic, in order to guarantee that it will be new. We must write this contract ourselves in order to make sure that it is our own and not the brainchild of constitutional or judicial scholars. It is an initiative based on gathering volunteers who will roam throughout Egypt—from Sallum and Siwa to ‘Arish, from Alexandria to Aswan—to ask people what they dream for Egypt in the coming years. What do they think life would be like in an Egypt where justice, equality, and respect are enjoyed by all? What is the best regime? How should we control those responsible for real estate matters, from the president to the worker? How should we interact with the police? What are the limits on the president’s powers? What mechanisms might enable the people to regulate wrongdoing?,,A campaign was launched in earnest and divided into three groups. The first is for public works, and it is responsible for gathering and distributing large numbers of volunteers with common dreams. The second group is for research and is responsible for investigating how to gather information and resources. It is also responsible for configuring the tools used by the public works group. The third group will be technological and will provide the technical tools to facilitate saving and indexing the information and creating good mechanisms for communication between the groups.,,This initiative will not succeed without you. It is open to all those who wish to participate. There are no requirements except the ability to dream. To participate, you can visit: The Hisham Mubarak Center for Law. 1 Suq al-Tawfiqiyya Street.

Freedom remains the prisoner of a military power that was not chosen by the people, but rather imposed upon them, under the pretense that there was no ruling power made up of popular revolutionaries that was capable of taking over power. Those wounded in the revolution are still begging for even their most basic rights from Sharaf’s government, which falsely claims he became Prime Minister with the Square’s blessing. A severe sluggishness still delays the trials of the former regime’s figureheads and those who killed the martyrs, while the judiciary has conspired with the regime in a blatant attempt to release these criminals from their trials with minimal losses.,,For these and other reasons, the martyrs’ families and the revolutionaries returned to Tahrir Square yesterday—to announce that the revolution continues and confront the security forces with a boldness no less than that with which the Egyptian people courageously tackled the confrontations on the 25th and 28th of January, in order to seize their rights in justice, freedom, and dignity.,,After Mubarak’s resignation, both the civilian and military branches of the ruling power tried to create a schism in the heart of the mass movement, between those in favor of a new constitution and those opposed. It is this very schism that the authority is attempting to bring into effect today, namely the division between those who want the constitution first and those who want it after the elections.,,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution believe that the battle now is not over the constitution or the elections, but the Square itself. Not just Tahrir Square, or al-Qa’id Ibrahim Mosque. Every factory in which the workers stand up for the right to a fair wage and a humane life is a square of the revolution. And in every field in which the farmers stand up against big landowners, there you will find the soil in which the seeds of this revolution were sown. And every public neighborhood whose ground has been graced by the virtuous blood of its martyrs, whose families have not yet obtained recompense, will continue to be the flame of this revolution until those families are compensated for the actions of the former regime’s figureheads and the killers of the martyrs. And every slum whose residents fight for the right to adequate and humane housing against those who own tens of thousands of luxurious living units is also a square of this revolution.,,To those who want this revolution to triumph, let us first go down into these squares and fight to achieve these demands. There is no sense in instating a constitution or holding elections in the continued absence of freedom, as civilians continue to be tried in military courts, workers exercising their right to strike continue to be arrested, sit-ins held by the families of the martyrs and the victims of eviction continue to be forcefully broken up, students continue to be prohibited from entering their exams and arrested for participating in political work at their universities, and conditions to impede the formation of political parties accumulate. Democracy is not a shape without substance; rather, its substance is brought to fruition when real liberties are granted on the ground, before there is a parliament or constitution. This is the real guarantee that both parliament and constitution will truly represent the will of the people and not the will of the political elite or those in power who were not elected. In the same vein, social justice cannot succeed with merely a symbolic increase in the minimum wage. The increase in prices of goods and services will certainly devour this extra income. Rather, social justice has many facets. It cannot be achieved without imposing higher taxes on businessmen, confiscating the fortunes of the past regime’s figureheads, businessmen, and the whales of the real estate market—whether in or out of prison. And it cannot be achieved until certain demands have been met—e.g. demands related to wages, health, housing, education, and other simple dreams with which the the military council and Sharaf’s government do not sympathize, since they are biased toward the businessmen and those who monopolize wealth.,,The military council will not meet these demands, and neither will Sharaf’s government. And trials of the regime’s figureheads, its corrupt individuals, and the martyrs’ killers will not achieve justice so long as this power is what controls the nation’s affairs. And the country’s foundations cannot be transformed into ones that work for the good of the masses in order to realize their aspirations and dreams without the existence of a revolutionary authority freely chosen by the people, who will judge this authority according to how much it adheres to the revolution and struggles to realize all of the revolutionaries’ demands. This is the work we now set out to do. The people are the ones who should write the constitution, not the law scholars isolated from all social life or those speaking on behalf of some authority. The members of the parliament should come from the factories, fields and popular neighborhoods, not from the political elites who do not represent any of the masses’ convictions. And because even today none of this has yet happened, we can say that the revolution has not ended. It has only just begun in the Square.,","Calls to Protest, Politics, Revolution, The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130151540im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled18.png,imgID442,

After 7 months, it has become clear that they haven’t done anything. On the contrary, it was clear that lots of people were taken unjustly, and there aren’t sufficient guarantees defending civilians [the cases happen in one session, without any examination of the papers, and the cruel rulings don’t accept any appeals or petitions, but rather only condemn or forgive!]. In addition to that, the real thugs—like those who engaged in highway robbery and burned the churches, or like those that attacked the martyrs’ families with bricks the day of the trial of the deposed dictator, all of them have not been tried! Then the injustice increased with the transfer of people who could not be thugs [normal people, journalists, artists, political activists] to military trials. This is at a time when the thugs that we deposed [Mubarak and his entourage] are being tried in civilian courts for their crimes of murder [and this is aside from the financial cases, which they have claimed they need to try in civilian courts so the money can be gotten back…and nothing has been gotten back]!!!,,Yes to the independence of the judiciary,,The reason:,,September 9th is the date of General Assembly meeting to call for the judiciary, which has been politically hijacked since the days of Mubarak, for the good of those that support the independence of the judiciary and the plan for an independent judiciary and the Revolution, like the consultant Ahmad Makki, Zakariya ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, Hussam al-Ghiryani and al-Bastawisi, and we must take to the streets to support them that day.,,We must realize these demands and not be divided in them, so we can guarantee getting our right to hold every official truly accountable and for truly free elections and trials.

Dignity to the Egyptians Abroad,2011-11-18,2011,"[box in lefthand corner:] Dignity to Egyptians abroad, Sunday 11 September, in front of the Kuwaiti Embassy in Cairo,,Dignity to the Egyptians abroad,,They say that revolutions eat their children. We say that any right that may be lost will be followed by demands. This is the secret to the success of the January 25th Revolution. This incident occurred in April 2010, approximately seven months before the blessed Revolution, and until now there has been no response either from our government or the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.,,The Egyptians Deported from Kuwait,,There was a group of Egyptian youth in the first revolutionary ranks, the first who believed in the inevitability of change and took it upon their shoulders to communicate demands for change to every Egyptian residing in Kuwait and to raise awareness about the necessity of forming a democratic system in Egypt. They could do this by joining the National Society for Change at its founding. No sooner had they met with a positive response from honorable Egyptians residing in Kuwait than they were arrested by Kuwaiti State Security, without prior warning, in an insulting manner snubbing the dignity of Egyptian people. They humiliated them with insults, slander, and physical aggressions. Then it was prison for them all, without a fair trial or an official investigation. After the Kuwaiti government sweet-talked the deposed tyrant, they were deported without any compensation or their savings, but rather with only the clothes they were wearing in full knowledge that they had not violated the law or the Kuwaiti constitution. The violation was carried out by the Kuwati state against its constitution. It further violated Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Right, both of which Kuwait signed and which became part of its domestic law. Then they were turned over to Egyptian state security in order to complete what the Kuwaiti government began i.e., torture, intimidation, constant surveillance and destroying any work opportunity that would enable them to meet the financial needs of their families. All of this so that they would be a warning to seven million Egyptians residing abroad in order to hold their tongues from demanding rights and the peaceful change of this repressive regime that we may guarantee, to every Egyptian at home or abroad, a generous life and sustainable dignity.,,All of this occurred with the cooperation of Egyptian ambassador to Kuwait and with the blessing of the head of the Egyptian community in Kuwait.,We are not begging anyone, and we are not demanding the impossible…but the time has come to achieve the demands of the Revolution.,,Dignity.

A Call to Our Great Egyptian People,2011-11-13,2011,"A Call to Our Great Egyptian People,,I am the Egyptian Citizen Hamdi al-Fakhrani, the claimant in a suit to invalidate the contract between Madinaty[1], Palm Hills, and Omar Effendi; dissolve the People’s Councils, the National Party, and the Egyptian-Kuwaiti Company; restore all the businesses of the pillaged public sector; and re-form The Dakhila Iron Company. Today, my children and I were exposed to serious death threats from the scattered remnants of the National Party, who have paid thugs to attack us throughout the Madinaty case, claiming to be workers of the Tal’at Mustafa Company. They were brought forward by the lawyer Murtada Mansur, who is defending the Tal’at Mustafa Company, along with Dr. Shawqi al-Sayyid and Mr. Muntasir al-Ziyat. Together, they form a triangle defending Madinaty’s corrupt contract. They want the land to remain violently tainted by dirty money, and to keep the people from getting their fair share, which has been frittered away in this suspicious contract. We would like our great people to know the following truths about Madinaty’s contract—truths which have been recorded in the court’s case file:,,1) The area of usurped land in Madinaty equals 33.6 million square meters, an area ten times larger than all of Sharm al-Sheikh.,,2) The state pledged to bring public utilities to the city limits.,,3) The Tal’at Mustafa Company has obtained complete customs concessions for all the proceeds of a municipal work estimated at 45 billion Egyptian pounds at the least. These concessions are for iron, cement, wood, electrical materials, and other material besides.,,4) The Tal’at Mustafa company pays for the value of Madinaty’s land in installments over 25 years – i.e. over 300 months [sic] – at the price of 297 Egyptian pounds— in other words, less than one pound per month per meter. This means that any student in primary school could buy 100 meters with his pocket money.,,5) This price equals one quarter of the customs concessions which the Tal’at Mustafa Company has obtained as a result of this suspect contract.,,6) This price equals half of the value of the public utilities which the State will bring to the project.,,7) We have proven in court by way of the company’s bookkeeping that Gamal and ‘Ala’ Mubarak are foreign partners in the Madinaty project through the Hurs Treasury for Investment.,,8 ) The Tal’at Mustafa Company has taken to selling a square meter in a pharmacy in Madinaty for the price of 60,000 Egyptian pounds—for a single meter! The price for a square meter in the residential units varies between 25,000 Egyptian pounds. The price for a square meter in the medical clinics is 20,000 Egyptian pounds—for a single meter! This is how the purchase of a meter of earth for a single Egyptian pound per month came to fruition: through the confiscation of the people’s riches in the name of the previous ruling gang, in full knowledge that, according to this contract, the State had no right to obtain any business or commercial properties in the Madinaty project. It’s well known that the value of the commercial stores alone equals the value of the residential apartments multiplied many times over.,,9) Because of this suspect contract, Egypt will lose more than 200 billion Egyptian pounds, as has been shown in court documents—a sum tantamount to the value of the land plus the value of the customs concessions which the company has obtained plus the value of the public utilities. All of these losses are carried by the noble Egyptian citizens, amongst them taxpayers and individuals who sleep under the open sky with no home, while the population of Madinaty enjoys golf courses, gardens, promenades and swimming pools without the Tal’at Mustafa Company paying the people their share—paying the Egyptians a share in their own land—and without even paying a fair price, which would be half the value of the proceeds, considering especially that the Egyptian taxpayer is expected to bear the losses and price of public utilities in this land. The taxpayer also must bear the customs concessions that the company has obtained for the benefit of the rich. For example, the company imports cement at the price of 200 Egyptian pounds per ton, while the regular, simple citizen cannot buy a ton of cement except at a price that exceeds 500 Egyptian pounds, at least. It is the same situation for a ton of iron, wood, and the rest of the building materials. All of this was performed at the expense of Gamal and ‘Ala’ Mubarak – the foreign partners in Madinaty by way of their suspect companies in the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, which are famous for money laundering and the drug trade.,,As for what happened to me in this affair… after the Revolution it was the wonder of wonders, something the mind never could have imagined. The company used a style of thuggery recommended by its new attorney Murtada Mansur: it sent thugs to to demonstrate in front of the court, alleging that they were workers in the company while blocking our way and attacking us – myself, my children and those supporting me – with blows and abuse in the presence of the police, who strove valiantly to protect me from them and cover me until the thugs departed from in front of the court. In one of the sessions, some of the thugs began to attack me, and one of them used a knife inside the State Council. But a few noble citizens who were with me – and they were very few – were able to save me from certain death. All of this was because there was no large number of noble Egyptian citizens with me, as most of the rest of the people rely upon. I am reassured that there have already been rulings issued in my interest in this matter, and there will be a new ruling issued as well. But this negligence and betrayal leads to the possibility of my losing the case in the Age of Revolution as a result of pressure from those who claim they are workers or shareholders in the company in the court, which has led to the the Committee of High Commissioners to issue a report in the company’s interest. This report represents a real danger and the possibility of our losing the case as a whole and the rights which the people have already won back.,,It is a shame to all of us that a judgement canceling this suspicious contract was issued in my favor and the people’s favor during the unjust period of Mubarak’s rule, and then—in the Age of the Revolution—a judgement was re-issued against the people and against us. It is a shame to all of us that the regime’s gang is able to usurp this land and more than 200 billion Egyptian pounds.,,With that, I call upon you as a whole to stand with me on the day the the court convenes–4 October 2011–at the State Council in the neighborhood of Dokki, Cairo, on Murad St. next to the Sheraton Hotel and near the Zoo at seven o’clock in the morning. I call upon you to attend in large numbers at an early hour, since the Tal’at Mustafa Company will send more than 4,000 workers and thugs at 6 o’clock in the morning. This was confirmed in a video published on YouTube which you can view and of which I have a copy.,,Notice #1: If the people don’t attend in large numbers, our rights will be completely lost. I call upon God and have said my peace; I call upon God and you, the people.,,Notice #2: I have filed a suit against the government of Dr. Sharaf, asking them to hire one million young people at a rate of at least 1,000 Egyptian pounds a month—without any additional burdens on the state budget—in order to prevent the continued employment of those government employees above the pension age. Their number totals 94,000 across all channels of state services. Some of them are more than seventy-seven years old, like Sami Mahran in the People’s Assembly, who has set his own salary at half a million Egyptian pounds per month, in addition to the hundreds who are more than sixty years old yet still receive more than a million Egyptian pounds per month. This suit’s court date was set for 2 July 2011 but has been delayed until 11 September 2011.,,Notice #3: I have filed another suit to require the government of Dr. Sharaf to reduce the maximum limit of salaries to 20,000 Egyptian pounds per month at most, according to worldwide average, with the exception of scientists, who will not be subjected to this condition. What has been made clear to me in documents is that there are more than 170,000 state employees in the Egyptian government who receive a salary of more than one million Egyptian pounds per month, according to a document issued from the Center for Information. Making this decision [to reduce salaries] was supported by the Ministers’ Council in October 2010–three months before the Revolution.

The Revolution Continues as Long as the Mubarak Regime Continues to Rule,2011-11-12,2011,"THE REVOLUTION CONTINUES AS LONG AS THE MUBARAK REGIME CONTINUES TO RULE,,Day after day, those in charge of the country’s affairs confirm that the Mubarak regime has not fallen—that Mubarak was merely a symbol of this regime, which represents the class of businessmen and those who plunder the resources that properly belong to the Egyptian people. Most of the faces have changed, but the policies that the regime followed under Mubarak’s rule are the same as those now followed under the military council and ['Isam] Sharaf’s government. As such, the regime is still biased towards the friends of capitalists and businessmen who get rich at the expense of, and off the labor and sweat of, millions of Egypt’s poorest sons and daughters.,,The Egyptian regime still insists on shackling freedoms and repressing the Egyptian people, and on making an example of revolutionaries in military and exceptional courts like the High Emergency Court of State Security. In fact, the regime announced — in a manner openly insulting the revolution and the blood of the martyrs — the continuation and expansion of Emergency Law, with highly flexible language to allow themselves to make the punishment of revolutionaries even more exemplary.,,We are demonstrating today to affirm that we have reached a point of no return where the application of the revolution’s goals is concerned. We are also commemorating the 29th anniversary of the Sabra and Shatila Massacre that claimed the lives of 3,297 Arabs, among them some Egyptians, though the great majority of them were Palestinian. This remembrance follows the martyrdom of six of our soldiers by Zionist bullets along the border, and the storming of “the nest of spies” in Giza, after which the regime presented tens of young people for trial before an exceptional court.,,We are from the Union of Socialist Youth, and because we affirm our non-recognition of the Zionist entity and our belief that every Zionist is a legitimate target, so we affirm that the struggle against the Egyptian regime is linked to the struggle against global capitalism and imperialism. It cannot be separated from the struggle against the Zionist entity — the obedient servant of global capitalism — and thus it is impossible to prioritize one issue over the other. Our struggle against the two is a struggle against global capitalism, which exploits the poor of the world, and at the heart of whom are the Arabs and Egyptians.,,And as we announce our rejection of the continuation of Emergency Law, so we dedicate ourselves even more intensely to continuing our revolution until the regime has completely fallen and a new regime that favors the poor of and producing classes of Egypt has been created—a regime that respects rights and freedoms and undertakes the redistribution of resources in a just manner. We will continue until several laws have been immediately ratified, among them minimum and maximum limits (on income), real laws against monopoly, the cancellation of support directed toward the rich, and the redirection of such support toward the poor.,,Union of the Egyptian Socialist Youth,Tahrir Square, 16 September 2011,,http://www.facebook.com/egy.socialist.youth,[phone number redacted]—[phone number redacted]—[phone number redacted],","Mubarak and Family, Regime, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130155415im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled10.png,imgID453,

Furthermore, a new electoral law has been drafted to guarantee that the remnants of the regime obtain the largest percentage of seats in the elections.,,Freedom was scandalously violated with the passage of a decree outlawing sit-ins and strikes, the disastrous activation of emergency law, and the practice of requiring military trials for civilians, while the trials of those who killed revolutionaries are still being delayed (where are the snipers?) as collusion to tamper with evidence and witnesses’ testimonies (for example, the witness who “didn’t see a thing”) runs rampant.,,Social justice is nowhere to be found. There has not been a true, favorable response to the millions of laborers, teachers, doctors, and employees who lost their rights and have resorted to striking to ensure that their voices would reach those responsible.

The Revolution… Moving Forward,2011-11-08,2011,"The Revolution…Moving Forward,,After eight months have passed since the eruption January 25th Revolution, the reality of the situation has not improved in any real way. On the contrary, the political developments and the laws that have been passed all point to maintaining the status quo as the situation deteriorates regarding social and economic developments.,,Indeed, the revolution erupted in order to express the popular, pent-up rejection of the lackey capitalist regime that stole the resources of the nation, as well as the rejection of its economic and social policies that ended up making the social and political situations worse due to establishing dependency on the colonial West. The revolution also expressed rejection of the economic and social policies that led to an unprecedented class disparity between the rich and the poor. There was also no democracy, in either its social or political form, with the attack on the independence of trade and workers’ unions and professional associations along with the absence of organizations and syndicates expressing the will of the poor peasants, the student unions, etc.,,There has also been the destruction of the political culture, in which both the leftist and rightist political parties have played their role as mere decoration under this corrupt regime. They did not oppose the social, economic and political regime, but rather they were merely competition, striving to divide the cake of power which the dissolved party of the deposed president monopolized.,,Indeed, the goals of the revolution that nearly 17 million Egyptians expressed across the squares of Egypt are completely different from what the vast majority of the elite are proposing. The goals of the revolution are manifested in the following:,,Regarding the nation: Independence with regard to political decisions and the end of colonialist and Zionist influence, including submitting all of the agreements with the Zionist enemy to a popular referendum. Also, the rejection of conditional economic and military assistance as well as criminalizing the foreign funding that has corrupted the political culture and damaged the security of Egypt.,,Regarding the economy, social issues, and democracy: Relying on an independent, self-sufficient policy for comprehensive growth. A halt to the privatization of the economy and restoring what has been sold back to public ownership, as well as changing the current system of ownership. A comprehensive revival in education, scientific research and national culture, harnessing democracy to promote the interests of the vast majority of the laboring people, like the working class and the poor peasants as well as the middle class. Restoring social rights to all of these factions of society, and expanding these rights, especially free education, healthcare, and low-income housing. Doing away with unemployment and establishing a minimum and maximum wage, restraining the market and promulgating laws that protect workers, as well as laws that guarantee the unity of the working class as well as the independence and democracy of trade unions.,,A law governing agricultural cooperatives that promotes the interest of the poor peasants and protects them from the control of the rich over the cooperatives, as long as the heads of all these organizations participate in the drafting of these laws. The utmost priority is on nullifying all of the laws that constrict freedoms, especially the Emergency Law and the law prohibiting sit-ins, strikes, and peaceful demonstrations.,,What guarantees the survival and the prosperity of our people is socialism.

Why have the Egyptians Revolted?,2011-11-05,2011,"Articles from the Revolution and Tahrir Square (28),,Why have the Egyptians Revolted?,Today is the Friday of “Correcting the Path”. There is no fault with this title despite its modesty in the face of the fierce attack from the counter-revolution. Today, those who dream of Egypt as a democratic, law-abiding state which respects social justice return to Tahrir Square, following the withdrawal of the army and military police, who left behind them the bleak memory of those forty days following the crushing of the revolutionaries’ sit-in on the first of Ramadan/August. This was the sit-in that forced the Military Council to change the government and the governors, and that forced the trial of “Mubarak” to be held publicly. Quickly, however, the trial was transformed into a non-public forum and then was placed under a gag order.,Before the 25 January Revolution, the question was posed: “Why don’t the Egyptians revolt?” But now, nearly seven months after the announcement that “Mubarak” was stepping down from power, we find ourselves facing the opposite question: “Why have the Egyptians revolted?” In this moment, there are many reasons for anger and revolution. It could be that the people in this country were highly provoked by the fact there there was no tangible change in the police’s interactions with citizens nor in their loyalties, even after Mubarak’s ouster. It suffices to mention two shocking scenes from last week. The first involved the families of the martyrs and those injured during the revolution , who while standing in front of the Police Academy were dispersed from the location of the trial of Mubarak, his two sons, the Interior Minister and his accomplices. The second scene involves the “Ultras” of the Ahli Football Club from Cairo Stadium to Salah Salim Street. In both of these scenes, we found the same insults and affronts to the humanity of Egyptian citizens, the same malevolence, spite and offense. The police are the police. They regard the citizens with a look of superiority and misappropriate their personages and human dignity. The police’s loyalty is to their leaders and the powers-that-be, not to the law. In all of this, the sincere devotion to Mubarak and al-Adili is what strengthens the belief that the singular loyalty to murderous gangs and thieves lies above any other loyalty or law.,The Egyptians have revolted and will continue to revolt, for their dignity, and so that the same policies, the same mentality in power, and oversight of the country’s affairs will continue. For no person is lower and no one is higher than just rewards or penalties. As for the laws that will determine the transition to a new political system—from parties to elections—their formulation will run its course in the dark. It will be directed so as to surprise us with the re-production of the same despotic, corrupt life; to keep power in the same localities and, on the national level, in the hands of the traditional families, the businessmen, and those most able to seek the recourse of monetary bribes and thuggery. The Egyptians have revolted and will continue to revolt because the media, administration, judges, and apparatus of surveillance and prosecution have yet to be purged of corrupt forces. Furthermore, there is no national dignity in working with Israeli racism, and building a wall around the headquarters of Tel Aviv’s embassy only provokes more sentiment,Simply put, they have revolted and will continue to revolt because of the continuing “Mubarakization”, even if the felled “Mubarak” is in the court’s cage. Egyptians have certainly noticed that witnesses’ recanting of their previous testimony in front of the prosecutors reflects a feeling that nothing has changed very much from the situation as it was before 25 January. “He” in whose hands the ultimate verdict, ultimate power, and the machinery of ruthlessness lie has not been changed. It would be impossible to put the entire regime itself on trial, but that which augments the Revolution of Anger is the imposition of a gag order on the most sensitive and influential of testimonies.,,Karim Yahya, Journalist for al-Ahram. 9 September 2011,,",Revolution,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162230im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled4.png,imgID460,

They are definitely not the officers of 1952, the ones that led a military coup and arrived at the seat of power through the force of arms, then clung to the reins of power since that day, and have been dividing the rule of Egypt among themselves up until now. They ruled until these heroes, youth from the Free Officers, came to join their people in their peaceful revolution with the utmost courage. They aimed to free Egypt from military rule, calling for the rights of the martyrs and for the judgment of the corrupt Mubarak, his aides, and all those who let themselves be seduced by stealing public wealth and the rights and freedom of the Egyptians.,,They are truly our heroic officers. I have seen them myself, and I have spoken with them and have confirmed their courage and their esteem for the significance of their actions. Hence they themselves are announcing, through the internet, their descent onto the streets in military attire to pressure the military council to clear the martyrs of wrong-doing and to judge the tyrant and his entourage.,,They are going out into the streets on Friday, like in the past, and have sworn to their people to go out into Tahrir Square without weapons. They are joining the different factions of the people with their military attire and their low ranks adorning their shoulders, lighting up the entire square and gracing it with their presence. The masses will rally around them, incredulous at the thought of them sacrificing their guaranteed future, and more events like this! Are they not the ones who during the revolution were guarding and securing Tahrir Square and the lively and important goals in every quarter of Egypt with their equipment and weapons?,,All of this is for Egypt’s freedom and its security and its dignity. They have sacrificed themselves and their future. They were saying to us: “We are not more virtuous than our martyred brethren who surrendered their souls for the sake of the freedom and the dignity of the nation. There had been a prevailing notion in the Egyptian street that said that the military council took power from Mubarak in exchange for a promise to him that they would protect him and his family from any issue or trial. This notion became ensconced in the minds of the people, for since the 11th of February up until the 8th of April, there has not been any sign of Mubarak’s trial – nor even that he or any the other heads of corruption in the country had been questioned.,,With the announcement of the huge million man march on April 8th, and the joining of the young officers to the people, the attorney general immediately began moving to build information, and the apprehension of the starkest eras of corruption began. The interrogation of Mubarak began, in preparation for his trial. The Agency for Illegal Gains has moved after being asleep for very long decades.,,I know that a lot of people are mistaken about the right of these young officers, and consider their coming down into the square and joining the protesters with their military attire to be incompatible with the military protocol mandatory for them. However, they remind me of the youth of the January 25th revolution who attacked armored police cars with their bodies, and jumped on them with the utmost courage and fearlessness. Can you understand this amazing behavior by reason alone?,,A few days ago the military courts issued jail sentences to 25 Free Officers varying between two to three years. That was after the court altered the charges from overthrowing the ruling regime and inciting discord to inciting riots. Does their standing peacefully with the people of Egypt to prevent the occurrence of discord between the army and the people – which is what the remnants of the past regime desire – count as inciting riots?!,,Field Marshal Husayn Tantawi must intervene by refusing to authorize these harsh sentences on the finest of Egypt’s youth, and grant them complete amnesty, for they are of you, and all of you are of us, the people of Egypt.,,",Military,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141646im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled2.png,imgID462,

Egyptians were transformed: where once they were as gears in the mills of corruption, despotism, and dependency, they became a people with dignity who can hold their heads up high.,,The National Council wishes to declare in no uncertain terms that continuing the million man marches constitutes a solution to the current indignities facing the revolution, including confusion, uncertainty, procrastination, slowness, and belittling the value of what the people undertook on the 25th of last January and the great miracle it wrought. If not for the million man marches, Hosni Mubarak would not have fallen, and the system of succession would not have been brought to an end. The counter-revolution and the remnants of the extinct regime would have been able to take a leading position once again, granting them capabilities and a large pool of funds from internal and external resources to draw from, including the strategic capital Mubarak once relied on—namely, presenting Egypt with two choices (not a third): “It’s either me (Mubarak) or chaos.”,,The National Council is with these million man marches until all of the revolution’s demands are met and until everything the revolution set out to achieve is accomplished and translated into work programs and well-organized implementation plans with clear time frames. Allow us to remind you of what the million man demonstrations have achieved so far: they have liberated the citizen and raised his head high, they have restored his dignity, and they have removed as many corrupt officials in the administration and security forces as they could. However, the majority of them are still still hold the same positions, even today, and are working out of their nests like bats do at night. They create discord, spread disunion, and are restoring the elements of the Mubarak family’s rule under different faces, some of whom don revolutionary garb. They imagine that these clothes hide the truth and cover their offenses, their sins, and their deviations.,,The million man marches are still a revolutionary, popular, and humane pursuit through which the revolution seeks to confront the fierce psychological war being waged against the people as punishment for having undertaken their grand, miraculous act. This war aims to bring the Egyptian people to their knees once again, and to compel them to return to the realm of tyranny and despicable characters, for it is a war waged by crooks, remnants of the regime, demons, organized militias, brigades of thugs, roadblocks, robbers, criminals, and rogues. These million man marches are among the most important and effective methods for combatting all of the above, exposing these despicable characters in front of the citizens. Thus, the demonstrations are the most important way to separate those loyal to the nation from those loyal to tyranny, and to ease the people’s feelings of isolation and defenselessness when faced with state officials’ inability to take action. This is the kind of political isolation and defenselessness that often follows revolutions.,,The Challenges,,Seven months after Mubarak’s ouster, Egypt still faces huge and unprecedented challenges that can be summarized as follows:,,,,,,,,,,Long live the glorious 25 January Revolution… Glory and eternity to the righteous martyrs, and wishes of quick healing and good health to the victims and the injured currently undergoing treatment.,,Date: 10 Ramadan, 1432 h.,7 September 2011,,The National Egyptian Council,37 Qasr al-Nil Street, 1st Floor – The Arab Republic of Egypt,Telephone: (202) 23920732 Fax: (202) 23920732,Email: morasla@almaglesalwatany.org,,","Calls to Protest, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130162213im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/untitled.png,imgID464,
Yes to continuing the sit-in… No to leaving the masses alone in the elections,2011-12-31,2011,"[page 1],,We hear many voices from the square calling for a boycott of the elections on the basis that they are part of an opportunistic game played by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and its allies to abort the revolution and evacuate it of its meaning. This comes at a time when revolutionaries are sacrificing their lives in the struggle to bring the demands of the revolution to fruition. It cannot be denied that a good number of the existing parties at the moment are only interested in obtaining the largest number of parliamentary seats and care nothing for completing the revolution’s goals. But besides this, there are a number of facts that we need to take into consideration in determining our position.,All the evidence confirms that the elections will be held whether we like it or not, that a significant number of people will participate in them, and that the elected parliament will draft the constitution that will govern our behavior for years and perhaps decades. So what do we do? Do we allow the counter-revolutionary forces to seize this opportunity monopolize the upcoming parliament and design the approved constitution, without the revolutionary forces contributing a word to its content? Is it in the revolution’s interest to have a parliament with some degree of balance—one that can stand up to SCAF—or should we leave it entirely to the opportunists in the Muslim Brotherhood and remnants of the regime, who agree to everything SCAF says? If we want to fulfill the goals of our sit-in, which is better: distance from the voting centers, isolation from the people, and enlargement of the gap between them and us? or is it in the revolution’s interest that we be present among the masses, joining them and explaining why we should insist on continuing the sit-in, pushing them to elect the best available forces? Insistence on boycotting the elections will leave the field open to opportunists who will seek to control the future of the country according to their own interests.,Therefore: in addition to continuing the sit-in until our demands are met, let us divide ourselves during the elections so that residents of Cairo vote on Monday and Giza residents stay to guard the square, and so on. This way we’ll choose the best-fitting replacement—one who can fulfill the goals of the revolution.,,Why do we refuse Ganzouri’s government?,Immediately after SCAF announced Kamal Ganzuri’s appointment as prime minister for the coming phase, it was clear that the revolutionaries in the square refused his leadership. The basic criticism was of his advanced age (78); but even if we agree with these reservations about his age, in reality there are other, more important reasons to refuse Ganzuri’s leadership.,Despite his humble beginnings, and the fact that while serving as Prime Minister during the deposed dictator’s time (1996-1999) he was as the “Minister of the Poor,” in fact a close look at Ganzuri’s history reveals that he was responsible for true violations of the Egyptian people’s rights. These crimes are no worse than the crimes of the deposed dictator, which we can observe as follows:,,,[title for picture sequence],The Heroes of Muhammad Mahmud,,[boxed text below photos],“Tweet Box”,-The Military Council are agents who go searching through old closets even though it would be easier to go down and buy from the street.,,[page 2],,The Revolution Continues,released by a group of revolutionaries—1—down.with.scaf@gmail.com,,[boxed text in upper right-hand corner],Call to all revolutionaries of Giza and the people of the second and third phases to gather together in Tahrir Sqaure on Monday and Tuesday to guard and protect the square as their brothers engage in the struggle to overthrow the Military Council by directing their energy toward the ballot boxes, preventing the manipulation of your votes—preventing them from being used for the benefit of opportunists or remnants of the former regime.,,To the Protesters Occupying Tahrir Square: Earn the Street’s Support, Claim Victory,Once more the revolutionaries are returning to Tahrir square, in a scene that reminds us of the glorious days of 25 January. Unparalleled heroes pay the price of freedom with their lives, after the experience of the last nine months taught them that Tantawi is Mubarak’s successor, and that SCAF is protecting the regime and opposing the revolution.,The slogan “Down the military rule” did not come from nowhere; since Mubarak ouster on 11 February, the revolution has been regressing because of SCAF’s policies and government, from military trials and the killing of revolutionaries in the street to the continuation of an economic policy that favors the rich at the expense of millions of the poor.,The revolutionaries in Tahrir and many other squares succeeded in toppling Sharaf’s government and are exerting pressure to obtain a government capable of preventing SCAF from consolidating and maintaining its power. However, the revolution remains quite from achieving its objective. We want to get rid of dictatorship once and for all, remove SCAF from power, and establish a system that will meet the revolution’s demands for bread and freedom.,Here we come to the central question from the heart of the square: will the tens of thousands of protesters occupying Tahrir and other squares suffice to fulfill this goal?,We have to recognize that the 25 January uprising was different from that of 19 November: the most recent uprising lacked the support of large sectors of people in the street. This was due to the regime’s dirty games and false propaganda—to mass support of some political forces on the one hand, and to mistakes we revolutionaries made on the other. For example, we neglected to organize and communicate with the street in order to explain our point of view, and we failed to mobilize the people into ranks for our cause.,Another important distinction between the two uprisings is that SCAF isn’t Mubarak; ousting one person from rule is not equivalent to demolishing and re-building a state that relies on an oppressive apparatus to rule, whether the armed forces or the police. To accomplish this, the revolution must be extended far beyond the square, to every street and every neighborhood—most importantly work sites, which can cripple this apparatus through work stoppages and public strike announcements.,We must therefore look to the 19 November uprising as a tremendous step in toppling the regime—one which will be followed by many other steps. The most important step is for the revolutionaries to strive, with patience and resolve, to communicate with people in the street outside the square, and to earn their support for the cause of the revolution. However, the accomplishment of this task requires the revolutionary powers to unite and organize their ranks.,We will fight our battles with SCAF everywhere: in squares, factories, fields, universities, at the polls, and elsewhere. We will rally and mobilize all the revolutionary powers in our war with military rule until we have wrested from it a country of freedom and social justice in which the people have the last word.,,[left-hand column],Capsule,The revolutionaries have exchanged their old demands for new ones. Here we try to explain these ideas and the differences between them:,-The National Salvation Government: will be formed by “politicians” agreed upon by the revolutionary bloc in society. This government will enjoy broad powers fundamentally determined by our ability to apply pressure so that these powers can be widened to the highest possible degree. This government will thus become a tool with which the revolutionaries can defend their freedom and goals in the upcoming period, until we can organize our ranks and win over bigger sectors of society to confront and remove SCAF.,-People power: Whether we agree on a civilian presidential council or a National Salvation government, in either case the only true guarantee that we will succeed in removing SCAF is if people organize themselves. That is, if people create organizations that can serve as alternatives to the current power: revolutionary popular committees in every neighborhood, work site, and university. Our mission is to bring the revolution everywhere. Our task is to help these committees fight for their causes and their direct demands wherever the two phrases ‘we want this’ and ‘how do we achieve it’ are co-present.,",Calls to Protest,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130150659im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/%D9%86%D8%B9%D9%85-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%85-0.png,imgID465,

Oh Revolutionaries of the Squares. They will not Rob us Twice!,2011-12-29,2011,"Oh Revolutionaries of the Squares. They will not Rob us Twice!,Let us form popular committees in all the revolutionary squares,,When the revolutionaries chanted for the continuation of the revolution they believed. They believed when they insisted that it had not been completed. Now it is returning, crashing into the squares. The price of freedom and justice is being paid for with the life and eyes of it youth. Ten months since the spread of the Egyptian revolution’s first spark, the foresight of those has been proven, those who called for not leaving the square, and those who sat-in time after time demanding retribution, the rights of the martyrs, the release of their colleagues who had been tried in military courts, and the departure of a regime that gave the military salute the first day, in order to steal good Egyptian hearts then swoop down and torture, arrest, judge and slaughter us today with its bullets and deadly bombs, revealing its true face. It has always been, since the first day, an extension of Mubarak’s regime.,,In the January – February round of our noble revolution, when the revolutionaries were facing the regime’s bullets with their bare chests in defense of their sit-ins, and when they were sowing the seeds of freedom with every martyr and injury, some elected themselves and decided to represent the revolution and speak in its name, claiming that it was a revolution without leadership. Thus they decided that they were the leadership. They stole the revolution and diverted the path of resistance into the path of negotiations, agreements, and documents that represented their interests. They wrestled with the constitution and the elections, denying the demands for retribution, for trying the killers, and for purging all the regime’s institutions.,,Today the same situation is repeating itself with more ferocity, and as parliamentary seats and political power float on the horizon, they ask full of insolence, “Who are those people in Tahrir?” We are answering them: “We are the youth of Tahrir, and all Egypt’s squares are the revolution. We are the revolutionaries of January and February, the revolutionaries of April, August, and September. We are those who did not sell out the revolution. We are those who do not forget the martyrs of yesterday and today. We are those who are being martyred now in the squares while your mouths water for power you do not deserve.,,This time, we will not let them steal our revolution.

They aimed to deface the revolution and the revolutionaries in several ways so that we would desire to return to the days of Mubarak. They have not achieved any of the demands of the revolution except, after being pressured, beginning the trial of Mubarak. Yet this trial was delayed for months so that all the documents and funds could be organized, and thus it was transformed into a farce.,,The Field Marshall came out with a statement full of lies—just like Mubarak’s speeches—to confirm his grip on leadership. After the speech he continued to use tear gas against the protesters who were defending the square and even against those who were praying. As for the elections, we don’t know how they will be carried out with the lack of security and the resolve of the remnants of Mubarak’s era, who have money, thugs, and the blessing of the Council.

The Crisis of Human Rights in Egypt,2011-12-24,2011,",Cairo: 25 November 2011,,On 19 November 2011, Egyptians again went out into Egypt’s streets and squares to demonstrate peacefully. The demonstrators were demanding a truly democratic, civilian state, similar to what they had dreamed of in January. Soldiers of the police and soldiers of the Armed Forces met them with excessive force, which led to the death of dozens of Egyptians and the injury of more than 3,000 peaceful, unarmed demonstrators.,,The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has followed many of the same policies and methods used by Mubarak’s regime in the repression of demonstrations and sit-ins: the use of excessive force against peaceful demonstrators, the killing of dozens of unarmed civilians, arbitrary arrest, exploitation of the media to distort the image of civil forces and human rights defenders, and working at the same time to increase the strength of extremist Islamic organizations, as a straw man to terrify Egyptians and the West, pushing them into de facto submission. This is the same strategy used by the ousted president.,,Over the past ten months, SCAF has busied itself with reproducing and inventing unprecedented means of repression in Egypt, many of which did not even exist under Mubarak. During this period, the military police have carried out extra-judicial killings and have murdered Copts without mercy, similar to numerous other incidents during which the military police forces and policemen fired live ammunition on unarmed, civilian demonstrators. Furthermore, thousands of civilians have been arbitrarily arrested during demonstrations and sent to exceptional military trials, and military trials of civilians have now become a matter of course. More than thirteen thousand civilians have been transferred to the military judiciary, among them thousands of peaceful demonstrators, activists, and bloggers. Michael Nabil and ‘Ala’ ‘Abd al-Fattah are merely two prominent examples of the thousands of other cases of civilians transferred to military trials. The majority of the trials do not last more than a single hour; defendants are without legal representation, and their prison sentences can range from one to five years. During their arrest and imprisonment, many of them are subjected to torture and other forms of inhumane and degrading treatment at the hands of police officers or soldiers of the military police. There is no doubt that women who participated in the peaceful demonstrations were subjected to mandatory virginity tests which had the purpose of stigmatizing female activists as prostitutes. This is an unprecedented practice in Egypt.,,The phenomenon of torture did not disappear in Egypt after the revolution, and is still widely and systematically practiced. Just as it was before the revolution, victims of torture include civilians against whom charges of thuggery have been fabricated, and activists, most of whom are from forces calling for democracy and a civilian state. After the January Revolution, the military police joined forces with the institutions that were practicing torture prior to the January Revolution in a number of these cases. The forced disappearance of political activists has reemerged as a phenomenon: activists are kidnapped by police and/or military security agencies, blindfolded, and led to unknown detention centers for investigation. Most of the time nothing is known about these activists until news of their disappearance has spread. After that, they are released.,,These violations have led to a climate that establishes impunity as a phenomenon in the absence of accountability mechanisms. Often the complaints and statements that are presented to the Attorney General’s Office are ignored, and victims from among those injured in the revolution (along with their families) are exposed, to say nothing of the martyrs’ families, who are continually pressured by those who committed violations to rescind their accusations. On top of all this, the current regime continues to be unable or unwilling to try the key figures of Mubarak’s regime for the crimes they committed over the past thirty years. It appears that Mubarak’s trial is basically a farce, and the opportunities for him to be cleared of the charges brought against him are increasing due to a lack of serious evidence-gathering and failure to provide witness protection. SCAF does not possess any real political will to set up a guaranteed system that will hold accountable those responsible for the violations of the last decades, as well as those responsible for the current violations. In addition to this, the former president Mubarak is only being charged with the crimes of killing demonstrators from the period of 25 January to 2 February, without any accountability for human rights crimes that he committed over the thirty years of his rule. It is worth mentioning that no reform has occurred with the Attorney General’s office, which in its authority is bringing charges against Mubarak and the rest of the officials of his era. It is still the same entity that operated under the Mubarak regime and played a pivotal role in covering up its crimes of torture, forced disappearance, and extra-judicial killings. It also worked to bring accusations against and organize investigations of figures that opposed Mubarak, such as Ayman Nur, Sa’d al-Din Ibrahim, and a number of youth activists like ‘Ala’ ‘Abd al-Fattah in 2006. The result is that those who committed human rights crimes in the past currently enjoy not only freedom, but power too, and are using it to restrict the margin of freedom while dealing with the families of the martyrs and the injured with contempt and violence as well.,,The state has participated in committing a number of violations against the Copts in Egypt. The massacre that occurred recently at Maspero is the latest in a series of violations committed against Christians in Egypt. Until now, the state has not exerted any notable effort to deal with the rising, continual violence practiced against Christians or taken their demands into account. This is due to the state’s establishing a policy of complete permissiveness, turning instead to mediation sessions (sulh) or religious leaders to solve these problems. Violent sectarian crimes under the Supreme Military Council’s rule have reached levels without precedent even in the age of Mubarak as a result of weakness on the part of the state (represented by the Military Council or the Ministry of the Interior) in protecting the Copts. Instead, it directly participates in discrimination against them, and sometimes in cases of direct killing such as what happened in the Maspero massacre.,,In this regard, the state has not only failed to remain loyal to its national and state commitments to suppress all forms of hate-speech and incitement to violence; it has done the opposite. It has played an active role in terrorizing media professionals from independent newspapers and channels, and in exerting pressure with the aim of forcing journalists, announcers and talk-show producers to practice self-censorship in their work, sometimes interfering directly to stop programs known for directing criticism against the SCAF’s performance. Both SCAF and the government have issued statements and declarations that could be called hate-speech: campaigns of incitement against foreigners that spread a general message that the foreigners in Egypt are spies and collaborators with foreign governments. The government press is constantly accusing foreign governments of interfering in internal matters and promoting foreign agendas that aim to drag Egypt into a civil war by pushing for the implementation of democracy—a charge which ties spying to the demand for democracy!,,In addition to this, SCAF did not meet the following pledges, which the Foreign Minister promised after the revolution: to ratify the optional protocol in the Convention Against Torture and Others Forms of Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Punishment, the optional protocol in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Protocol on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and the Rome Convention for the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Likewise, SCAF also failed on its promise to permit the opening of a regional office in Cairo for the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights—a promise which it vowed it would keep.,,SCAF has busied itself implementing policies that are hostile toward democratic transformation and respect for human rights. It has been leading the transitional process with methods that confirm the birth of a new authoritarian regime: by using repressive measures against activists from civil forces calling for democracy, and by restricting the space available for these activists in the public sphere.,,During the last ten months, SCAF has launched unprecedented attacks on those organizations and social movements that were the driving force of the revolution. During this period, SCAF has worked to target youth organizations, civil society, and human rights organizations in particular, as well as recently formed parties. It is worth mentioning that these organizations have presented, in the post-revolution period, a great number of ideas, laws, rules, directions, and strategies to guarantee a peaceful and democratic transition in Egypt, among them suggestions for a roadmap and time table for the transfer of power, judicial reform, security reform, media reform, and proposals for putting an end to the problem of sectarian violence. SCAF has ignored these proposals.,,While human rights organizations have been striving to apply pressure for the sake of adopting reforms that would realize the Egyptian people’s aspirations to enjoy dignity, freedom, equality, and social justice, and have been playing their role in observing and condemning the different forms of violence and violations that the country has witnessed, the Supreme Military Council has been issuing laws and decisions that follow policies which aim to protect its special privileges and extend its power over any independent, civilian government in Egypt.,,Perhaps the most recent talk by General Muhsin al-Fanjari, a member of SCAF, will help clarify the Council’s view about the role of civil society organizations. According to what he said, verbatim, in a call-in on one of the TV channels on 19 November: “I am saying, sir, that some of the civil society organizations have this concept that they work for the good of the society and not for the good of the government. The meaning of this is that they have an oppositional approach against the government!” This means, as he also said, “that work against the government means work against the state!”,,Where respecting economic and social rights is concerned, SCAF’s behavior is not very different from that of Mubarak’s regime. After several promises to pass a law on trade union freedoms, it broke all its pledges, and the law remains a proposal locked in a drawer somewhere, never having seen the light of day. Also, after issuing a decision to dissolve the General Federation of Trade Unions in Egypt, a decision was then issued for it to again return to work, in addition to the promises that did achieve the implementation of a minimum wage.,,Perhaps the one difference between the violations that Mubarak practiced and those that SCAF practices now is who is targeted in these violations. Where Mubarak targeted the extremist religious forces, the Military Council has begun working with some of their key figures, who now work in the capacity of advisors, helping to solve crises of a sectarian nature, and offering aid and support, not to mention popular backing, while the Military Council directs all types of repression, including extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrest, forced virginity tests, and military trials against victims, who basically, whether they are professional media workers, bloggers, liberals, leftists, human rights workers, normal citizens, or soccer fans, have no relationship or affiliation with any political stream or faction; their only demands are for freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. It is worth noting that SCAF did not apply the law even in the cases where extremist religious groups committed crimes that threatened social peace between Muslims and Copts, such as the events at the village of Sul’s church, which extremists demolished over the span of two days with any response from the authorities. On the contrary, the Military Council and the military police showed excessive use of force and intentionally killed a group of Coptic demonstrators in front of the Maspero building instead, who were protesting the destruction of another of their churches at the hands of extremists in the village of al-Marinab in the Aswan governorate.,,It was decided to hold the elections for the People’s Assembly in the coming week on 28 November, and that these elections would continue until 13 January 2012, in the midst of a repressive climate, the gross violations described above, and the unprecedented campaign against civil society organizations. This is a situation that threatens the running of free, impartial elections and destroys any hope of democracy, in particular the attacks and threats directed toward human rights organizations, which are expected to monitor and document continuing violations . Likewise, these organizations’ ability to observe the election process and participate in the creation of democratic system is threatened.,,If Egyptians have taken to the streets and the squares once again – in this, the second wave of the 25 January Revolution – it is not only because they doubt the neutrality or integrity of the election procedures or the sincerity of expression of their results; it is also because they oppose the series of successive human rights violations witnessed in the last ten months and reject all the practices that they revolted against in the age of Mubarak. Therefore, in order to emerge from this crisis, SCAF should do the following:,,- Immediately halt all forms of violence, extra-judicial killing, and arbitrary arrest that SCAF and the Ministry of the Interior practice against the opposition, especially peaceful demonstrators,- Transfer all of SCAF’s authority to a temporary civilian government for the period of the transfer of power to an elected government and an elected president of the republic,- Entrust the High Judicial Council with the mission of carrying out independent investigations of all crimes committed against demonstrators after the twenty-second of February, especially the crimes committed against the women of Egypt who were exposed to virginity tests, the crimes of the Maspero massacre, and the crimes of killing demonstrators in Tahrir Square since the nineteenth of February; endow the investigative body that the High Judicial Council will form with the power to carry out investigations of officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces and the SCAF,- Immediately halt all military trials for civilians, guarantee to release those that were arrested for merely expressing their opinions, and give retrials in civilian courts—in front of normal judges—for those who committed criminal offenses,- Commit to implementing the principle of the rule of law; guarantee just trials in dealing with crimes of sectarian violence; guarantee to take swift legal action against any incitement to religious hatred,- Immediately end the state of emergency; completely review all laws that directly impact the personal rights and freedoms of individuals, among them the law of military trials,We aim to protect and develop the bases of the civilian state, and for the complete participation of all sectors of society, especially civil society organizations, in a constructive and transparent dialogue about the critical decisions relating to the transition period and the formation of an independent country.,,The signatories:,,- Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies,- The Egyptian Group for Raising Social Participation,- The Human Rights Association for Helping Prisoners,- The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information,- The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights,- The Habi Center for Environmental Rights,- The Hisham Mubarak Law Center,- Egyptians Against Religious Discrimination,- The Arab Organization for Penal Reform,- The Freedom of Thought and Expression Foundation,- al-Nathra for Feminist Studies,,","Culture, Demands, Prisoners, Security Forces",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141449im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Crisis-of-Human-Rights-0.png,imgID472,

Last Chance Friday to Save the Nation,2011-12-19,2011,"[Logo: The Egyptian Socialist Party],,Last Chance Friday to Save the Nation,,,The Interior Ministry’s violent repression of the Tahrir sit-in on Saturday, 19 November has exploded a revolution of the Egyptian people’s anger. Millions went out to the Squares of Tahrir in cities across the Republic and swore not to leave until they were successful. The Interior Ministry’s violence was nothing but an impetus for this discontent. The latent reason for this anger was the wide realization of the Military Council and government’s failure to achieve any tangible progress for the country in seeking to achieve the goals of the revolution, those which they promised to achieve and what can be summed up by the slogans “Change, Freedom, Social Justice.”,,Of course the Military Council is responsible for this repression, and the Ministry of the Interior does not have the capacity to represent leadership and control. Democracy is not merely elections, but rather it is the right of the masses to sit-in, strike, and protest, and to purge and re-build the Interior Ministry. The Military Council announced concessions on Thursday afternoon: investigations into, and apologies for, the killing and repression of the people, honoring the martyrs, treatment for the wounded, the construction of a wall to protect the demonstrators, and the formation of a ministry over the course of the next few days with the authority to express the success of the protesters in putting in force an important aspect of their demands. Yet it remains for the Ministry to confirm a plan that ensures social justice, a plan that previously did not receive a response. Indeed the biggest voice is that of elite employees and business men who, with loud voices, insist on their refusal of an increase in taxes, a decrease in social services, and setting a maximum wage to fund a minimum wage. The budgets for education and healthcare continue to drop while the plans for privatized healthcare and the agreement to the patronage of the World Bank continue! The minimum wage remains at the level it was before the revolution with a limited increase of benefits. The poor suffer from the increasing deterioration of their livelihoods during the time of revolution because their incomes remain fixed despite an increase in prices.,,The protesting people ask for the achievement of their demands, which can be summarized with the slogan, “Democracy for the People and Social Justice Now,” by means of:,,,Long Live the Egyptian People’s Struggle and Glory to the Martyrs.,,The Egyptian Socialist Party,","Calls to Protest, Other Parties, Politics, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130150715im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Untitled8.png,imgID477,

They must be held accountable, as those who were injured must be immediately compensated along with the families of the martyrs.,,AND LASTLY,We agree with and defend the necessity to transfer power from the Supreme Council of Armed Forces to elected representatives of the people.

This means for the transfer of all the Military Council’s authority and the return of the army to performing its duty of protecting the nation’s borders.

"Dissolving the Local Councils Is a Victory for the Revolution, But ..",2011-12-15,2011,"Revolutionary Egypt Vol. 8, Page 3:,The ruling issued by the administrative court Tuesday, 29 June, to dissolve the local councils is considered the realization of one of the revolution’s demands, along with the dissolving the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council in the previous period, as an expression that these three bodies are representative bodies, which the National [Democratic] Party distorted by rigging their elections.,As happened with elections for the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council, the National [Democratic] Party insisted on not winning by a simple majority, but by a majority that did not allow a single partner in these councils. It was capable of the crudest rigging of elections, in which it received 54,000 seats, making up some 98% of the local councils, and leaving only 350 seats, or 2%, to the opposition. This is what happened in the last elections that took place for these councils in 2008.,What is meant by the local councils is the local popular councils found in the centers, cities, neighborhoods, and villages and whose work was regulated by the outdated law number 43 of 1979 for local administration and its amendments. Contrary to what it may seem to many, the local popular councils play an important role in the lives of citizens and wield a major influence on them. They are distributed in small units, such as neighborhoods in cities, estates and hamlets in the countryside, and small villages in the desert regions; they are, therefore, the ears and eyes that pick up the problems of people. In the absence of any form of popular oversight over the local councils, corruption and bribery spread and the citizens went without basic services; rather, the local councils came to be administered for the benefit of the National [Democratic] Party’s lackeys and its thugs.,This was one of the most important reasons many of the political forces and parties held firmly to the necessity of dissolving these councils, as part of disposing of the previous basic instruments of rule. This is particularly the case in view of the impending legislative and presidential elections, so that remnants of the National [Democratic] Party do not exploit the members of these councils to influence the will of the electorate to the advantage of these remnants who put themselves forward as candidates .. This demand has been the subject of controversy between those demanding the dissolution of these councils and the government of `Isam Sharaf, which insisted in their remaining. For reasons exemplified in article 144 of the law of local administration, it is not permissible to dissolve all of these councils in a comprehensive step or a single decision. But it is permissible for the cabinet, within specific conditions, to dissolve a number of them so long as elections to replace them are held within sixty days from the date of their dissolution .. It was the view of those of the revolution’s forces that held fast to the decision to dissolve [these councils] that these reasons were not logical, that the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council had been dissolved by an administrative decision from the Military Council, and that the government was able to issue a similar decision regarding the local councils, to dissolve these councils definitively .. With the government’s insistence on its position, a group of those demanding the dissolution [of the local councils] resorted to the administrative court, and put forward a legal action demanding that the negative decision that the government had taken—against dissolving these councils—be overturned. Last Thursday, they succeeded in receiving a ruling on this.,After the revolution, it became necessary to overturn the law of local administration ? ? and prepare a ? new ? ? revolutionary ? law of local administration ? .. ? basing its legal provisions on the post–popular revolution period ? .. ? and spare us from a law tailored ? ? to serve the interests of ? ? unscrupulous ? ? members of the National [Democratic] Party ? .. ? who profited at ? the expense of the people ? gaining out of it quick profits and bribes ? ? by the millions ? !!,All the revolutionaries in the “Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution” must work to cancel the outdated law of local administration with its loopholes and make a new revolutionary law guaranteeing transparency, decentralization, and popular oversight.,If the supervisory role of the popular committees is one of the most important axes of their work, then their role in the popular supervision of the elected local councils will be one of the most important of its tasks in the coming phase. This begins with contributing to putting in place proposals for the new law for the local councils and putting forward honorable candidates, as well as monitoring the integrity of the elections and following performance to guarantee provision of basic services to the Egyptian people, who finally regained their power over their country and will never abandon it.,,[Graphic in the center of the page: The People Want to Purify the Country],",Regime,NA,imgID481,
Freedom .. Social Justice.. Human Dignity,2011-12-14,2011,"[Revolutionary Egypt Vol. 8, Page 3:],Today the Egyptian Revolution stands at a crossroads after the passage of nearly five months since the fall of Mubarak and his gang’s symbols .. But what millions of revolutionaries on all Egyptian squares asked for, the regime’s downfall and the realization of freedom, social justice, and human dignity, has not materialized yet.,Freedom: we do not feel it in the shadow of the past regime’s symbols remaining widespread in all the state’s institutions, including the universities, the media, theInterior [Ministry], the governorates, and even within the government and the Military Council. It is to the extent that every day they humiliate civilians and activists in military tribunals and issue laws criminalizing strikes and sit-ins. They employ the Interior’s men and the regime’s thugs to violate dancers with bayonets and swords, while murderers of revolutionaries and snipers enjoy freedom.,Social justice: is far removed with the continuation of an economic and social policy in favor of a handful of businessmen and investors at the expense of millions of Egyptian factory workers, farmers, laborers, employees, and pensioners. We did not see any steps taken to reduce the enormous differences between a few hundred owners of millions, whose wealth was under the corrupt regime, and millions of Egyptians who dream of the most basic human rights: something to eat, health care, housing, and education.,Human dignity: invalidated daily in police stations and on the streets. It is violated by the violence and repression of the police and the military police and the cruel military judgments, which ruin years of the lives of the revolution’s youth and scorch their relative’s hearts.,For the revolution does not govern yet, and it has not yet assumed power. Those who assumed power instead of the revolutionaries still serve the former regime’s policies and, indeed, benefit from them. Therefore they strive to empty the revolution of its goals and are satisfied with whitewashing the regime’s face, not toppling it and building the people’s power. Likewise, some tendencies that participated in the revolution are satisfied with gaining the right to form parties openly and sought to halt the train of the revolution at parliamentary elections. Their limited party interests ignore that the blood of the martyrs and the injured was shed only for the sake of a complete victory of the revolution.,Today, there is no path ahead of all the revolutionaries and believers in the Egyptian’s right to a free and dignified life except to continue the revolution to complete its goals.,The clash of wills must now be resolved in the interest of the revolution.,,","Demands, Revolution",NA,imgID482,

Who is al-Ganzuri?,2011-12-09,2011,"Who is al-Ganzuri?,,- The man who ruined the Planning Institute when he was the Minister of Planning eliminating its capabilities and abolishing its role as a creator of development policy. This resulted in a distorted economic policy that serves the rich at the expense of the poor.,- From the moment he became the Prime Minister, he led the privatization program. The privatization during his term was characterized by the worst types of corruption, such as al-Marajil al-Bukhkhariyya [Steam Boilers] and Hadid al-Dakhila [Dakhila Iron], which represented the beginning of the Ahmad ‘Izz phenomenon.,- He is the head of the Tushki Project, in which he gave al-Walid ibn Talal, the Saudi billionaire, 1% of Egypt’s land for a single millieme.,- He is the head of the Aswan Iron Project, from which Ahmad ‘Izz has been accused of benefiting, and, after importing machinery for millions, this project has been found to be of no economic benefit. The result of these huge imaginary projects was a severe liquidity and cash crisis.,- His government failed to deal with the financial crisis in East Asia in 1997 when it swept across the world. He was the one who threw Egypt into an economic recession that lasted more than three years.,- The rising stink of corruption emitted from his office, and the head of his staff, Tal’at Hammad, was sacrificed and presented before the court.,- The husbands of his daughters are famous for their involvement in suspicious deals in return for valuable gifts. Within a single year of his appointment as Prime Minister, one of the husbands became the owner of a private childrens’ hospital, three Mercedes, a Cherokee, and a Peugeot after having only owned a Fiat 128. He was not ashamed to boast that he got a gift, the newest Jaguar model, without any taxes.,- Kamal al-Ganzuri is an example of one of Mubarak’s men: mixed up in corruption and without scruples. The evidence is that he worked with this regime in various posts for more than 17 years, always advancing to higher and higher posts. Why has al-Ganzuri been silent all these years? To put it simply, it is because he is implicated in the corruption of the previous regime, and the evidence is in the following news report:,,The Attorney General, the consultant ‘Abd al-Magid Muhammad, has resolved to include the names of each of the previous Prime Ministers, Kamal Ahmad al-Ganzuri and ‘Atif Muhammad Muhammad ‘Abid, on the no-fly lists and to monitor their movement due to the accusation of their having wasted public money by selling the Ideal Company to the Olympic Electric Company.

Statement from the Square,2011-12-08,2011,",Statement from the Square,,Egypt is now witnessing the outbreak of a critical revolutionary wave that is engulfing many of the Republic’s provinces, led by Tahrir Square. The revolutionary significance what is currently happening is its focus on a screening of political forces, coalitions and figures that claimed to favor the January Revolution. The screening has also distinguished, on the one side, the people from the lethal Military Council, the extent of whose hostility to the revolution has been made abundantly clear along with its blatant bias in favor of the old regime that they are trying to renew.,,Revolutionary obligation compels us now to fully acknowledge the lessons of the past nine months, We believe the most important factors to have been the refusal of any discussion with the “Military Council of Running People Over,” and the unequivocal refusal of all authorities who now attack the great revolutionary wave and accuse its heroic steadfast youth of being a discredited minority. In order to impede elections and prevent certain political forces from controlling parliament, they accuse its wounded and the families of its martyrs of being paid political thugs. These authorities would, by means of this control, attempt to hinder the revolution and interrupt its path, all the while distracting the public from its anti-revolutionary activities so as to attack its freedoms and interests.,,It is now necessary to urge the most important goals of the January Revolution, goals for which thousands of the country’s greatest sons have given their lives, and continue to give their lives blood, and freedom so that they may be realized.,We see them to be the following:,,1. A revolutionary government from Tahrir Square that does not include any element from the old regime, nor from the forces allied with the Military Council.,,2. The formation of a revolutionary tribunal composed of honorable judges aligned with the revolution that we choose from the square to try Mubarak, his gang, and all the chief elements of the old regime, including the commanders of the military and police.,,3. Granting full private and public freedoms to the Egyptian people, such as freedom of thought, expression, and religion; the freedom organize unions, political groups, and local groups.,,4. The immediate release of all of the revolution’s prisoners from military prison and Egyptian prisons.,,5. Confiscating all of the wealth of the deposed family and that of the regime’s supporters, including the corrupt businessmen and officials during the past 30 years.,,6. Recovery of all of the nation’s economic institutions (companies, factories) that were included in the corrupt and suspect privatization programs.,,7. Recovery of the people’s land that were stolen by the corrupt regime.,,8. Setting the minimum wage at no less than 2000 guineas while the highest wage will be no greater than ten times the minimum wage.,,9. Immediately enacting triumphant revolutionary laws that meet the needs of the working class by providing job opportunities and free and complete education and health service as well as public housing, potable water and sanitation services for the poor.,,10. Immediate distribution of the reclaimed land to poor and middle class farmers and the cancellation of all of their debts. Initiation of a cooperative agricultural movement for farmers owned and directed by the agricultural development and credit bank. Setting prices of raw materials and determining prices for the sale of crops.,,11.

Defining the Monitoring Movement,2011-12-07,2011,"Defining the Monitoring Movement,,The Monitoring Movement is a popular one based on volunteer work, and it is not politically biased. It is not affiliated with any political party or ideology. It seeks only to play an effective role in promoting the democratic experience in Egypt and offering the best electoral climate for the Egyptian people.,,Our Vision,We believe that power is inherently corrupt, and that it is therefore hopeless for any people to maintain any of their rights unless through vigilance, observation, and accountability. This is why we established this movement; not because we are confident that the coming period will be full of justice and freedom, but because of our belief that what is to come will certainly be worse if we do not exercise our role and duty in supervising the executive powers. This process of supervision is only part of a complete process that includes raising issues and awareness, protesting, coordinating and networking, civil disobedience, and other forms of civil and popular work.,,Our Goal:,The Monitoring Movement seeks to become part of the monitoring process for the general elections (legislative, presidential, and local) as an interim goal that we complete with a eye towards building a strong current of popular oversight over all executive powers in the country.,,Our Approach:,The Monitoring Movement is administered by area, meaning we operate in a completely decentralized manner, in accordance with the basic values of the movement and its terms of reference. For every geographical group (which we call an “area”) undertakes only two activities: 1) forming geographical groups to serve the goals of the movement, and 2) monitoring the different elections.,,For this reason, the central administration of campaign affairs defers to what each geographical group deems necessary in its region. The central entity only exists in order to serve of these groups, and this entity forms working groups to offer services that cannot be divided up, such as: website administration, gathering information and writing reports, coordinating the media for campaign work, networking with different groups and political organizers, and finally coordinating trainings and the resources necessary for these trainings. In order for these centralized groups to be administered with transparency, no member of the movement is barred from taking part in them; members may even attend their meetings in order to monitor them from within. These groups’ meeting-times must therefore be announced so that we all are able to work with the utmost transparency.,,[graphic]: Monitoring Movement, Working Towards Popular Monitoring],[phone number redacted],Facebook.com/moorakpa,Twitter @moorakpa,m.elections @gmail.com,","Movements, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130153155im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Untitled3.png,imgID489,

It is on this premise that we announce our definitive refusal of the document that proposes supra-constitutional principles, drafted by Dr. ‘Ali al-Salmi. The consideration of this document as binding for the people would cause a dangerous crisis in Egyptian political society. Until now we have hoped that Dr. ‘Ali al-Salmi would submit to the popular administration, but he has not.

Statement 2: Refusing the Speech of the Field Marshall,2011-12-03,2011,"Statement 2: Refusing the Speech of the Field Marshall,,The occupiers in Tahrir Square announce their complete refusal of what was stated in the Field Marshall Tantawi’s speech with regard to the solution to the current crisis. They affirm that they feel deeply insulted by the audacity of the regime to propose only partial solutions with regard to the fall of the martyrs, by the absence from the speech of any apology for what occurred—or earnest discussion of it, or any clear promise to punish the responsible parties.,,Likewise, the speech did not mention any cases of the tragedy of the civilian detainees imprisoned for pending military trials. The Field Marshall did not broach the issue of their immediate release, which is one of the most important demands of Tahrir Square now.,,He also ignored the question of the punishment of those who murdered the martyrs during the 25 January Revolution. They still have not been punished, notwithstanding the ten months that have passed since they committed their crimes and also in spite of the Military Council’s repeated promises that justice would take its course in this matter.,,The questioning of holding the corrupt accountable —chief among them the deposed President— did not receive any attention from the Field Marshall.

The elimination of the Military Council in the administration of the country and the transfer of all of its power to a national revolutionary rescue government with wide competences.,2.

We Will Not Give Up on the Revolution and We Will Not Make Due with a Quarter Revolution,2012-01-27,2012,"Friday 5/27/2011,The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance,(Under Construction),We Will Not Give Up on the Revolution and We Will Not Make Due with a Quarter Revolution,Why did we go out today into the squares and streets of Egypt?,- Because we object to the Military Council’s delay of the trials of the leaders of the past regime that stole the money of the people, toxic torment, and indulgence of Mubarak and his family. Meanwhile the Council treats peaceful protests with excessive harshness, such as insulting and torturing the protesters in front of the Israeli embassy.,- Because we see that not only are the Military Council and the government not serious in liquidating the leaders of the old regime in different institutions, but they are also calling for some of them to participate in the alleged national dialogue sessions and are honoring others with appointments in the governorates.,- Because the media, which the Military Council rules with a vice grip, misleads the people just as it did during its former era . Not only do some journalists not place the Council above criticism, but they are also paving the way to build a new tyranny comprised of the Military Council and its members.,- Because the restoration of security is one of our most important demands. We hold the Military Council and the government responsible for failing to provide security for the people because of its failure to hold police officers who were involved in crimes of murder and torture accountable and its failure to take effective measures to purge the police apparatus and rebuild it on a new foundation.,- Because we are disturbed to the highest degree by the lack of determination in dealing with those causing sectarian strife, despite their multiplicity.,- Because the Military Council and media’s statements try to hold the people and their demands for social justice responsible for the country’s bad economic conditions despite the fact that the principle cause of this is the lack of restoration of security and the increasing popular refusal of the road map that the Military Council put in place to guide the transitional phase.,For all these reasons we are not assured of the competency of the Military Council, its ability to run the country in this transitional phase, or its effective management of future challenges our country will face over the next decades. So for this reason we call on the national leadership, the leaders of the youth alliances, the leaders of the independent unions, and all people concerned with the protection of the revolution of the Egyptian people to:,1) Administer a true national dialogue to form a presidential council the majority of which is comprised of civilians that possess the necessary legitimacy to administer the country during the transitional period and are committed to completing the goals of the revolution.,2) Build a road map for the transitional period that guarantees the creation of a new Constitution for the country first, before holding any elections and before the formation of an elected assembly that ensures a broad national consensus and guarantees the representation of every sector of the people from different religions and political ideologies. A Constitution of any country is more dangerous when formed by committee chosen at the discretion of a parliament—even if it is elected.,3) Review all laws that were issued by decree without a social, foremost the laws criminalizing strikes, demonstrations, and sit-ins as well as the party law and the law of direct political rights. Stop issuing any new laws without wide dialogue between the people and the political powers.,We look forward to the Military Council accepting everything that the people demand of them: protecting the country from dangers of which only God knows the extent.,Total Democracy for the People…Total Dedication to the Country,","Politics, The Party of the Popular Socialist Alliance",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141244im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled21.png,imgID496,
"It is Not a Second Revolution, but Rather an Ongoing Revolution until the Regime is Toppled",2012-01-26,2012,"It is not a second revolution, but rather an ongoing revolution until the regime is toppled,,Six months of attempts to circumvent the January 25th Revolution and drown it in negotiations, promises, committees, alliances, a referendum that nearly split the ranks, and a constitutional announcement that is nothing but a repeat of the ‘71 Constitution granting the Military Council all the powers of the overthrown president. Six months of loitering and collusion to save whatever remnant of Mubarak’s regime can be saved. Six months, and the people are crushed by poverty, hunger, repression, military trials, and the Interior Ministry’s thugs. The demands of the people are put up on the shelf until the trinity of the counter-revolution, the Military Council, the Interior Ministry, and the businessmen finalize arranging their affairs and dividing the country amongst themselves. It used all means to fool the people into thinking that the country requires stability, that a piece of bread is a factional demand, and that yesterday’s revolutionaries have become thugs. The media supports them, and decries the revolution with the same speed with which it decried the overthrown president. The straw that broke the camel’s back came with the verdict to release the officers that killed revolutionaries, in addition to the release of some of the ministers accused with corruption. The families raised the slogan “blood is paid for only by blood”, and everyone who called for giving a chance to the Military Council and Sharaf’s government realized that the regime had not changed. That the purge had not touched but some of the prominent figures, leaving the Interior Ministry, the army, the governorates, and the big businessmen intact, and that the military salute that the martyrs received from Military Council after the overthrow of the dictator was nothing but nothing but an attempt at deception and an playing with our emotions.,,Six months have witnessed a separation of political force between the revolutionaries and those who rode the revolution’s wave to achieve their political and economic goals. Six months the people have remained waiting for the realization of the revolution’s goals of freedom, social justice, and human dignity, yet not one of them has been achieved, and at the same time the overthrown president, the symbol of corruption, repression and oppression, lives comfortably in Sharm al-Shaykh where the hand of justice is nowhere near him. Six months of lying, trickery, and the tyranny of money and power that utterly disregards the blood of hundreds of martyrs, the inability of thousands of injured to work, the oppression of the poor, the workers, and the peasants whom Sharaf’s government demanded push the wheel of production in order to pump more money into the pockets of the businessmen. The people have realized that the regime still remains, and that the regime will not fall except with organized masses in the street. Thus, they have returned to complete the revolution, in more than ten governorates in all parts of Egypt, from Upper Egypt to the coast to the canal. This time there is no return until the regime falls. This means:,,,What is happening in Egypt’s squares and streets now is not a second revolution, but rather it is an extension of the January 25th Revolution after the people realized that the revolution is not over with the fall of one of the leading figures, that they are sole owners of this revolution, and it cannot be entrusted to anyone except their sons and daughters, their workers and its peasants, their old men and their youth. The Military Council could not be entrusted with it, and it was not given to Sharaf’s government, but rather its owners are the Egyptian people, the only true owners who can decide its path and goals. They are only ones deserving of its victory. They have confirmed that authority listens only to the roaring voice of the masses when they demand the toppling of the regime. and that retribution for the martyrs’ blood will not be achieved expect by the revolution’s trials.,,Glory to the martyrs, victory to the revolution, and power to the people,,Revolutionary Socialists,9 July 2011,","Movements, Regime, Revolution, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141324im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled20.png,imgID497,
"Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 8",2012-01-26,2012,"[Revolutionary Egypt, Vol. 8, Page 1],A progressive publication issued by the Popular Committees to Defend the Revolution,,Revolutionary Egypt,Issue 8, July 2011,,Trials, Trials…the Gang is Still Ruling,,This slogan was raised in more than one demonstration prior to January 25, and it remains very appropriate in regards to what is happening today, six months since the outbreak of the noble 25 January revolution. Was it less than six months ago that one of the leaders of the armed forces stood in front of the TV screen to send a military salute to the martyrs? Many Egyptians regarded this as auspicious, especially the families of the martyrs who read in the military salute an admission from the Military Council of the price that their sons and daughters paid for freedom, social justice, and human dignity. If the Military Council were sincere in its military salute, and if the current regime were sincere in its “happiness” about the revolution, then the first thing following their military salute should have been the arrest of: Hosni Mubarak, the high commander of the police apparatus; Habib al-‘Adli, the previous Minister of the Interior; ‘Umar Sulayman, the torture engineer in Egypt and the world; and all the leadership of the Interior in the Ministry and State Security. Let public trials for these symbols begin immediately for the torture, repression, and killing that they committed—not only over the span of the 18 days, but also over the span of 30 years—against the sons and daughters of the Egyptian people.,,But something like this did not happen. Rather, the previous president and high commander of the police is still living in Sharm al-Shaykh surrounded by his wife and superior medical care, careful that the dictator is not struck by depression. The previous Minister of the Interior was sentenced for financial corruption before he could be prosecuted for killing Egyptians and ordering the fire of live ammunition at them. Whoever went to the latest session of the trial, which decided to postpone for a third time, felt as though that matters were continuing as they were prior to February 11, when the Central Security were blockaded the families of the martyrs behind iron barriers. Hisham al-‘Iraqi, a State Security officer famous for his repression of demonstrators, moved security forces in front of the court, in addition to the tanks of the army, military police, and special forces, as if the revolution had been undertaken to multiply the forces repression instead of holding them accountable.,,The issue is not limited to Habib al-’Adli, but in every court session for the officers accused of killing demonstrators, officers come to protect their colleagues so they are hidden from the press cameras and the eyes of the families. They attend their trials and just go back to their workplaces, as if they were just paying a visit to the courtroom. Only yesterday, the court in al Sharqiyya and Suez let off the accused officers. Every time, security forces took pains to protect the accused and guarantee their departure and their families’ departure from the court so that they would not face the anger and torment of the martyrs’ families. It was as if the martyrs were the criminals and the officers were the victims. What’s more, the head of the court in Suez asked the security apparatus to stand in two parallel lines between the seats of the families of victims and the accused officers so that clashes would not break out between them, and then issued his decisions to postpone the trial and release all of the accused!!,,On 11 February Egyptians chanted in Tahrir Squares: “The army and the people are one hand.” Today Egyptians chant: “The people and the people are one hand.” This is the lesson of the past six months, which have witnessed not a single legal ruling against the killers. Beginning from the killers of Khalid Sa’id, to the killers of the last martyr in Tahrir Square only a few days ago. With this slogan, the Egyptian people are returning to the street again on July 8, not to disagree about the constitution and the elections, but to complete their revolution against the ruling gang in Egypt.,,Campaign against the law criminalizing protests and military trials for civilians,,A number of independent trade unions, political parties, and activist and popular groups launched a campaign to challenge the law criminalizing suspicious protests and the transferring of civilians to military courts. They said, in a statement issued by the campaign, that they reject the enactment of the law criminalizing social and economic protests. They consider it a glaring violation of freedoms and the 30 March, 2011 constitutional announcement what stipulated the preservation of workers’ rights. They will stand together against this oppressive law, which aims to gag in particular the mouths the workers and the poor in general, striving to raise the slogan of social justice that is at the core of the Glorious Egyptian Revolution’s demands, and likewise for the right of all Egyptians to express their opinions and defend their rights without discrimination. In the conclusion of its statement, the campaign announced a number of demands, which are: (1) Trying the killers of the martyrs; (2) Eliminating the law prohibiting strikes; (3) Immediately releasing the workers from Suez Canal companies and implementing all of their demands; (4) Vacating the sentences issued against the 5 workers from the company Petrojet; (5) Permanently hiring all temporary workers; (6) Forcing the resignation of the heads and the members of boards of companies, institutions, and banks involved in embezzlement of public funds, and who profited from their positions; (7) Abolishing the abusive sanctions issued by corporate leadership against the union leadership that expose their practices, whether in transferring, mandating, or firing; (8) Setting minimum and maximum wages, including a guarantee to minimize the disparities between incomes and guaranteeing a dignified life for workers, and indexing the relationship of wages to the prices of goods, services, and average number of dependents in society; (9) Granting the right to form independent trade unions; (10) Modifying the texts of the work law, including guaranteeing the stability of work relationships, the achievement of job security, and the limit of the boss’ authority to employ arbitrary firing.,[Page 2:],To Those Who Want Revolution… The Revolution is in the Square.,,[flag in picture:] ‘Freedom’,,More than five months have passed since we forced the criminal to step down from power, and yet justice, according to the overwhelming majority of the people, still cannot find its way. Freedom remains the prisoner of a military power that was not chosen by the people, but rather imposed upon them, under the pretense that there was no ruling power made up of popular revolutionaries that was capable of taking over power. Those wounded in the revolution are still begging for even their most basic rights from Sharaf’s government, which falsely claims he became Prime Minister with the Square’s blessing. A severe sluggishness still delays the trials of the former regime’s figureheads and those who killed the martyrs, while the judiciary has conspired with the regime in a blatant attempt to release these criminals from their trials with minimal losses.,,For these and other reasons, the martyrs’ families and the revolutionaries returned to Tahrir Square yesterday—to announce that the revolution continues and confront the security forces with a boldness no less than that with which the Egyptian people courageously tackled the confrontations on the 25th and 28th of January, in order to seize their rights in justice, freedom, and dignity.,,After Mubarak’s resignation, both the civilian and military branches of the ruling power tried to create a schism in the heart of the mass movement, between those in favor of a new constitution and those opposed. It is this very schism that the authority is attempting to bring into effect today, namely the division between those who want the constitution first and those who want it after the elections.,,The Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution believe that the battle now is not over the constitution or the elections, but the Square itself. Not just Tahrir Square, or al-Qa’id Ibrahim Mosque. Every factory in which the workers stand up for the right to a fair wage and a humane life is a square of the revolution. And in every field in which the farmers stand up against big landowners, there you will find the soil in which the seeds of this revolution were sown. And every public neighborhood whose ground has been graced by the virtuous blood of its martyrs, whose families have not yet obtained recompense, will continue to be the flame of this revolution until those families are compensated for the actions of the former regime’s figureheads and the killers of the martyrs. And every slum whose residents fight for the right to adequate and humane housing against those who own tens of thousands of luxurious living units is also a square of this revolution.,,To those who want this revolution to triumph, let us first go down into these squares and fight to achieve these demands. There is no sense in instating a constitution or holding elections in the continued absence of freedom, as civilians continue to be tried in military courts, workers exercising their right to strike continue to be arrested, sit-ins held by the families of the martyrs and the victims of eviction continue to be forcefully broken up, students continue to be prohibited from entering their exams and arrested for participating in political work at their universities, and conditions to impede the formation of political parties accumulate. Democracy is not a shape without substance; rather, its substance is brought to fruition when real liberties are granted on the ground, before there is a parliament or constitution. This is the real guarantee that both parliament and constitution will truly represent the will of the people and not the will of the political elite or those in power who were not elected. In the same vein, social justice cannot succeed with merely a symbolic increase in the minimum wage. The increase in prices of goods and services will certainly devour this extra income. Rather, social justice has many facets. It cannot be achieved without imposing higher taxes on businessmen, confiscating the fortunes of the past regime’s figureheads, businessmen, and the whales of the real estate market—whether in or out of prison. And it cannot be achieved until certain demands have been met—e.g. demands related to wages, health, housing, education, and other simple dreams with which the the military council and Sharaf’s government do not sympathize, since they are biased toward the businessmen and those who monopolize wealth.,,The military council will not meet these demands, and neither will Sharaf’s government. And trials of the regime’s figureheads, its corrupt individuals, and the martyrs’ killers will not achieve justice so long as this power is what controls the nation’s affairs. And the country’s foundations cannot be transformed into ones that work for the good of the masses in order to realize their aspirations and dreams without the existence of a revolutionary authority freely chosen by the people, who will judge this authority according to how much it adheres to the revolution and struggles to realize all of the revolutionaries’ demands. This is the work we now set out to do. The people are the ones who should write the constitution, not the law scholars isolated from all social life or those speaking on behalf of some authority. The members of the parliament should come from the factories, fields and popular neighborhoods, not from the political elites who do not represent any of the masses’ convictions. And because even today none of this has yet happened, we can say that the revolution has not ended. It has only just begun in the Square.,,Come, let’s write our constitution…,,We like to catch the reader’s attention from the start and say that this article is not calling for the constitution first, nor the elections first, nor is it important to us which one comes first. What is important to us is that we are a true part of the equation.….,,The general sentiment right now among many citizens is the following: it is as though they are sitting in lines of onlookers, or on the reserve bench during an important game, waiting for whoever will score the first goal. Will it be the constitution-first supporters, or elections-first supporters? Will it be the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafists, the Liberals, the Socialists, or the youth movements? The Egyptian public that once congregated around the revolution now stays away from it and has begun to watch it as if it were a strange child not even a day old. They do this even though they know the truth, which is that what happened on 25 January was for all of us citizens in whose name ‘the elite’ speaks. They fill the world with noise. Newspapers, satellite TV programs, social-networking sites—through these media they speak in our place, discussing our desires, dreams, and ambitions without ever asking one of us how we see it.,,We are speaking to you today about an important initiative to make us a true part of the equation. It is possible that this initiative can overcome the errors that the elite have made while speaking on our behalf. “Come, let’s write our constitution” is an initiative launched by a group of people interested in public action. It is an invitation to think together about the social contract we can dream up for our “new” Republic, in order to guarantee that it will be new. We must write this contract ourselves in order to make sure that it is our own and not the brainchild of constitutional or judicial scholars. It is an initiative based on gathering volunteers who will roam throughout Egypt—from Sallum and Siwa to ‘Arish, from Alexandria to Aswan—to ask people what they dream for Egypt in the coming years. What do they think life would be like in an Egypt where justice, equality, and respect are enjoyed by all? What is the best regime? How should we control those responsible for real estate matters, from the president to the worker? How should we interact with the police? What are the limits on the president’s powers? What mechanisms might enable the people to regulate wrongdoing?,,A campaign was launched in earnest and divided into three groups. The first is for public works, and it is responsible for gathering and distributing large numbers of volunteers with common dreams. The second group is for research and is responsible for investigating how to gather information and resources. It is also responsible for configuring the tools used by the public works group. The third group will be technological and will provide the technical tools to facilitate saving and indexing the information and creating good mechanisms for communication between the groups.,,This initiative will not succeed without you. It is open to all those who wish to participate. There are no requirements except the ability to dream. To participate, you can visit: The Hisham Mubarak Center for Law. 1 Suq al-Tawfiqiyya Street.

But what millions of revolutionaries on all Egyptian squares asked for, the regime’s downfall and the realization of freedom, social justice, and human dignity, has not materialized yet.,Freedom: we do not feel it in the shadow of the past regime’s symbols remaining widespread in all the state’s institutions, including the universities, the media, theInterior [Ministry], the governorates, and even within the government and the Military Council. It is to the extent that every day they humiliate civilians and activists in military tribunals and issue laws criminalizing strikes and sit-ins. They employ the Interior’s men and the regime’s thugs to violate dancers with bayonets and swords, while murderers of revolutionaries and snipers enjoy freedom.,Social justice: is far removed with the continuation of an economic and social policy in favor of a handful of businessmen and investors at the expense of millions of Egyptian factory workers, farmers, laborers, employees, and pensioners. We did not see any steps taken to reduce the enormous differences between a few hundred owners of millions, whose wealth was under the corrupt regime, and millions of Egyptians who dream of the most basic human rights: something to eat, health care, housing, and education.,Human dignity: invalidated daily in police stations and on the streets. It is violated by the violence and repression of the police and the military police and the cruel military judgments, which ruin years of the lives of the revolution’s youth and scorch their relative’s hearts.,For the revolution does not govern yet, and it has not yet assumed power. Those who assumed power instead of the revolutionaries still serve the former regime’s policies and, indeed, benefit from them. Therefore they strive to empty the revolution of its goals and are satisfied with whitewashing the regime’s face, not toppling it and building the people’s power. Likewise, some tendencies that participated in the revolution are satisfied with gaining the right to form parties openly and sought to halt the train of the revolution at parliamentary elections. Their limited party interests ignore that the blood of the martyrs and the injured was shed only for the sake of a complete victory of the revolution.,Today, there is no path ahead of all the revolutionaries and believers in the Egyptian’s right to a free and dignified life except to continue the revolution to complete its goals.,The clash of wills must now be resolved in the interest of the revolution.,,,Dissolving the Local Councils is a Victory for the Revolution, But…,The ruling issued by the administrative court Tuesday, 29 June, to dissolve the local councils is considered the realization of one of the revolution’s demands, along with the dissolving the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council in the previous period, as an expression that these three bodies are representative bodies, which the National [Democratic] Party distorted by rigging their elections.,As happened with elections for the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council, the National [Democratic] Party insisted on not winning by a simple majority, but by a majority that did not allow a single partner in these councils. It was capable of the crudest rigging of elections, in which it received 54,000 seats, making up some 98% of the local councils, and leaving only 350 seats, or 2%, to the opposition. This is what happened in the last elections that took place for these councils in 2008.,What is meant by the local councils is the local popular councils found in the centers, cities, neighborhoods, and villages and whose work was regulated by the outdated law number 43 of 1979 for local administration and its amendments. Contrary to what it may seem to many, the local popular councils play an important role in the lives of citizens and wield a major influence on them. They are distributed in small units, such as neighborhoods in cities, estates and hamlets in the countryside, and small villages in the desert regions; they are, therefore, the ears and eyes that pick up the problems of people. In the absence of any form of popular oversight over the local councils, corruption and bribery spread and the citizens went without basic services; rather, the local councils came to be administered for the benefit of the National [Democratic] Party’s lackeys and its thugs.,This was one of the most important reasons many of the political forces and parties held firmly to the necessity of dissolving these councils, as part of disposing of the previous basic instruments of rule. This is particularly the case in view of the impending legislative and presidential elections, so that remnants of the National [Democratic] Party do not exploit the members of these councils to influence the will of the electorate to the advantage of these remnants who put themselves forward as candidates .. This demand has been the subject of controversy between those demanding the dissolution of these councils and the government of `Isam Sharaf, which insisted in their remaining. For reasons exemplified in article 144 of the law of local administration, it is not permissible to dissolve all of these councils in a comprehensive step or a single decision. But it is permissible for the cabinet, within specific conditions, to dissolve a number of them so long as elections to replace them are held within sixty days from the date of their dissolution .. It was the view of those of the revolution’s forces that held fast to the decision to dissolve [these councils] that these reasons were not logical, that the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council had been dissolved by an administrative decision from the Military Council, and that the government was able to issue a similar decision regarding the local councils, to dissolve these councils definitively .. With the government’s insistence on its position, a group of those demanding the dissolution [of the local councils] resorted to the administrative court, and put forward a legal action demanding that the negative decision that the government had taken—against dissolving these councils—be overturned. Last Thursday, they succeeded in receiving a ruling on this.,After the revolution, it became necessary to overturn the law of local administration ? ? and prepare a ? new ? ? revolutionary ? law of local administration ? .. ? basing its legal provisions on the post–popular revolution period ? .. ? and spare us from a law tailored ? ? to serve the interests of ? ? unscrupulous ? ? members of the National [Democratic] Party ? .. ? who profited at ? the expense of the people ? gaining out of it quick profits and bribes ? ? by the millions ? !!,All the revolutionaries in the “Popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution” must work to cancel the outdated law of local administration with its loopholes and make a new revolutionary law guaranteeing transparency, decentralization, and popular oversight.,If the supervisory role of the popular committees is one of the most important axes of their work, then their role in the popular supervision of the elected local councils will be one of the most important of its tasks in the coming phase. This begins with contributing to putting in place proposals for the new law for the local councils and putting forward honorable candidates, as well as monitoring the integrity of the elections and following performance to guarantee provision of basic services to the Egyptian people, who finally regained their power over their country and will never abandon it.,,[Graphic in the center of the page: The People Want to Purify the Country],[Page 4:],Translation forthcoming.,",Revolutionary Newspapers,https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141327im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Untitled6.png,imgID498,

Together… To Support the Revolution,2012-01-22,2012,"Together … To Support the Revolution,Four months after the outbreak of the heroic 25 January Revolution we find that the demands of the Egyptian people are not being met. The Egyptian workers joined the revolution and more than two-hundred workers were martyred along with hundreds of young men and women. It was their strikes that determined the first chapter in the removal of the regime’s head. The revolution started to achieve these demands and is still going on. However the official statements, whether from ministers or the Military Council, show that the demands for social justice and an honorable life are not amongst the priorities in the coming stage. Additionally, there is an inexcusable lack of progress, especially with regards to political reformation. The ousted president is still negotiating to avoid his trial, while some of the major figures of corruption are still being released with bail and there are repeated suggestions for granting amnesty to the president in exchange for him giving up his money. This is our money and a result of our sweat and the sweat of the marginalized and poor sons and daughters of the Egyptian people.,As for social and economic rights that were an essential part of the revolution’s demands, we are finding a dishonorable alliance between the businessmen and power. The poor are always being told about the importance for patience and to wait for the return of the “production wheel”, which is currently pouring into the pockets of the wealthy and increasing their wealth without a share for the Egypt’s workers. Moreover, in the last speech by the Egyptian finance minister he said that we will institute a minimum wage of 1200 EGP within five years and that the policy of the ministry today is to focus on supporting the middle class. This essentially means that the poor have to wait for when the rich rearrange their affairs and the middle class takes back its place.,These policies, which do not differ from the period before the revolution, are not devoid of efforts to suppress the freedom to unionize, oppress workers’ freedoms and criminalize strikes, which is a constitutional and legal right that the laborers extracted during long years of struggle. In fact our colleague ‘Ali Futuh, president of the independent union for public transportation, was turned in to be investigated and sent for trial for exercising his rights as a union member in establishing the independent union and organizing the workers to defend their rights.,For all of the above the Workers Democratic Party (currently being formed) announced its solidarity with the demands of the Egyptian people, young and old, laborers, farmers, employees and students. It announced its insistence on completing the tasks of the revolution that is still in its first stages and its resisting the policies of political and social oppression side by side with the young men and women of Egypt. Hence, it has announced that it is joining the second revolution of anger on Friday, 27 May, 2011 and that it will fight with all revolutionary groups of people so that the revolution is not limited to main squares but rather envelops the very essence of the country: the companies and factories. It has been demonstrated that they are able to bring down the hand of political and social tyranny.,Workers of Egypt, unite to support the glorious revolution on Friday, May 27 at Tahrir Square.,,Glory to the martyrs and victory for the revolution.,,Workers Democratic Party,27 May 2011,Party spokesman: The engineer Kamal Khalil,Telephone: [redacted],Email: [redacted],Facebook page: Voice of the Workers (Sawt al-’Ummal),","Solidarity, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141735im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled16.png,imgID502,
The People Say Their Piece,2012-01-21,2012,"The People Say Their Piece,,Gentlemen Members of the Supreme Council of the Egyptian Armed Forces (the ruler),,My Warm Greetings,,,I speak for the Egyptian people, who have suffered from illness, ignorance, theft, and willful exploitation, followed by deliberate killing and deliberate foot-dragging in giving them justice. I want my revolution, and my country, Egypt, and I have paid the price with my own blood, suffering in defense of my country. I want Egypt for myself and not for the beneficiaries or the supporters or the opportunists of the past regime or anyone else who had wanted Egypt for themselves. Give me Egypt or I will take her myself. I am capable of doing so.,,I want a response to the following question. Distinguished members of the assembly, you must give me an answer: Why did we start a revolution?,,I will give you my answer. We, the Egyptian people, started our great revolution for life, freedom, social justice, overthrowing the regime, trials for corruption, and to restore Egypt to greatness. So, distinguished members of the assembly, what is your response? What have you done to make the goals of the revolution – which the Egyptian people defended with their innocent blood – a reality? No one understands the value of this sacrifice more than you, and you have given due tribute to the blood that was shed. For the sake of the blood you shed in 1967, you rebuilt Egypt from nothing. So why can you not do the same now? Without hearing your response, we know that the country’s present state doesn’t reflect any gains from the revolution. (The revolutionaries themselves are its remnants).,,Why are we repeating the same empty gestures when we have the same goals and the same path? We will speak with one voice: the people and the assembly both want Egypt to prosper. How can we achieve this, when the present administration delivers nothing but future political conflicts and deliberately keeps the country insecure? The path to economic and political reform will not be found in responses to demands of different social classes on one another, and refusals to others. This will lead to economic and social crisis, an extension of the same policies that the deposed president excelled in for years.,,Distinguished members of the assembly, you are not excused for the situation in which we now find ourselves because you command the people’s respect, trust, and obedience – so what did you do? Where are the real trials? Where is the plan for reconstruction? Where is the government fit to perform these tasks?,,Distinguished members of the assembly, you came with a ministry that could not even run the affairs of a small governorate. Where is the strength of the laws, after the events that tarnished the prestige of the country and unleashed a mob on Egypt? What’s the story of this lengthening transition period, which you yourselves established? Why is there so much confusion over your successive proclamations on the constitution? And what of the referendum laws? And who are your civilian advisors, and where are their loyalties?,,Distinguished members of the assembly, do you remember that the revolution saved you from what was your due inheritance; if not for us, the ‘respected’ Gamal would be in charge he would chair all the gatherings of your honorable assembly. (What had you planned on doing about that, exactly?),,We all love Egypt and have grown accustomed to the Egyptian military, who are the rightly-guided leaders of the efforts to improve political behavior – because you have sown the seeds of destruction by delaying reform of security, society, and the economy.,,I want my revolution, distinguished members of the assembly, and I want rebuild my country again so that she might endure and not perish.,,I want a constitution that can reform our health system, or education and our economy.,,I want a strong government, elections from lists, and nationalist projects.,,Egypt, I wrote your name with my blood, on the paper of my suffering.,,,Signed,,,An Egyptian citizen,,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141332im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/untitled.png,imgID503,

Advice to all Voters,2012-01-18,2012,"Advice to all voters,,The Messenger of God (may the peace and blessings of God be upon him) says:,,“Whoever is not concerned with the Muslims’ matters is not a Muslim”,,From this basis, due to the requirements of responsibility and in order to preserve the faithfulness that will be asked about on the Day of Judgment, I am sure that there are many people for whom the righteous path that pleases God and his Messenger is important. This is the path that Islam drew for us, and following it leads us to salvation in this world and the hereafter. The straight path is the one that corrects the way of life and places it in the foremost position in the eyes of God and advances His religion in all economic and social aspects of life along with every other one.,,When we hear others say “We want the Islamists to tell us what their electoral program is,” it should be obvious that the Islamists’ program is known and understood and no one would deviate from it except a sinner. And it is: “God said this and the Messenger said this.”,,This is the best of programs. It is a program that takes you to bliss in this life and in the hereafter. For within Islam there is everything that is suitable for humankind. There is advancement, civilization, and an honorable life. We are now living through a dangerous period of transformation in the life of Egypt in which our country is one, our future is one, and we have only one opportunity in our hands. We must choose Islam, its principles and values, and its tolerance and protection of the rights of others and the People of the Book. These principles and values produce one people that is concerned with the affairs of the Muslims and with the beneficial, true, peaceful, legitimate way and these people support each other. The Messenger of God (may the peace and blessings of God be upon him) says: “The believer is to his brethren like a structure where each part supports the other, like interlinked fingers.” Both al-Bukhari and Muslim relate this. The Messenger (may the peace and blessings of God be upon him) says “The example of the believers in their mutual friendship, mercy, and sympathy is like the example of a single body. If one part of it complains, the rest of the body falls ill with sleeplessness and fever.” The Islamic program guarantees the orphan’s financial and physical security, aid for the needy, social interdependence and treating the People of the Book in the best manner and guaranteeing them their rights. An Islamic state is based on fixed and firmly rooted principles that come from a firm and solid base.,,The Qur’an is a constitution that organizes everything in life. For every large and small thing, it regulates it and sets its boundaries. It is no secret to any reasonable person that Islam contains the best for Egypt, its people, and all the Muslims and non-Muslims. It has a well-known and understood program with no falseness or deviation from the truth. It contains everything that is suitable for mankind.,,I advise every Muslim to use his reason and choose the best for our country. We are choosing who represents us and takes us to the right path.,,My brother, it is enough to cast your vote for a candidate that calls for the implementation of God’s Shari‘a, the Shari‘a of justice, the Shari‘a of equality, the Shari‘a of love for God, the Shari‘a of work, the Shari‘a of the pure creation and good deeds. If we counted up the advantages of this Shari‘a, we would not have enough paper to write all of them.,,*For we are proud for Shari‘a to be our constitution and the source of our legislation*,,I call on every voter to cast his vote for the candidate that agrees in his program to work on implementing Islamic Shari‘a. I advise everyone to choose what his heart tells him to do for the sake of his religion and his salvation. This is also for the sake of God’s religion as well as Egypt and its people.

The Shadow Government Representing the Youth of the Revolution: Reclaiming the Revolution,2012-01-17,2012,"The Shadow Government Representing the Youth of the Revolution,,Reclaiming the Revolution,,More than eight months after the 25 January Revolution, power has not yet been transferred to the youth and the change for the sake of which all the citizens acted has not happened. Instead, events are becoming increasingly worse day after day to deliberately and purposefully make this revolution fail. The presence of the Military Council is nothing but a line of defense for Mubarak, the figureheads of his regime, and the centers of power within and outside of Egypt.,,In accordance with the circumstances in which Egypt is now living—including the distortion of the revolution, application of the emergency law, the lack of clear, established rules for achieving social justice, and the insistence on creating a weak People’s Assembly subservient to the Military Council and unrepresentative of the people and the revolution—we call on the great Egyptian people to continue the revolution until all the demands of the revolution are met and complete power is transferred to the people.,,We proclaim the following demands:,,1 – Cancel the emergency law which is not implemented except against political opposition and is considered unconstitutional in light of the second constitutional declaration approved by the Military Council which stipulates in Article 59 that “in all cases, announcement of a state of emergency is for a fixed period which does not exceed a period of six months, the duration of which is not to be extended except by a popular referendum agreeing to such.” Therefore, Presidential Resolution #126 of the year 2010 to extend the state of emergency to confront the danger of terrorism, upon which the Military Council relies for implementation of the state of emergency, is tacitly invalid under the text of that Article as the state of emergency had been applied for longer than six months.,,2 – Make a law to remove all members of the National Party from politics along with anyone who held an executive position from general manager to Prime Minister and all military or police leaders who undertook civil work during the period of Sadat and the deposed Mubarak.,,3 – Stop military trials, cancel the judgments made against the youth of the revolution, and immediately free those imprisoned.,,4 – Make a time table for the transfer of power to the people that guarantees elections for the People’s Assembly, the Shura Council, and the presidency no later than 25 January 2012.,,5 – Put in place real mechanisms to grant independence to the judges, the media, and the Noble al-Azhar.,,6 – The resignation of all university leaders, without exception, and holding fair elections without limiting the participation of the youth.,,7 – Enact minimum and maximum wages.,,8 – Stop the judicial and political futility of the trials of Mubarak and the figureheads of his regime by putting in place guarantees for their fairness.,,9 – Immediate and serious action to recover the people’s money, which Mubarak and the figureheads of the regime smuggled out of Egypt.,,10 – The resignation of all the leaders of the regulatory bodies and the strategic and national companies of the state.,,Our Facebook page: The Official Page for the Shadow Government Representing the Youth of the Revolution www.facebook.com/government2,Email: [redacted] [phone #s redacted],,","Demands, Revolution",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141341im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled13.png,imgID507,

We love our country and we believe it is wrong for people to live with injustice, oppression, tyranny and corruption for a period of many hopeless years. We realize that there is still corruption, and that the revolution for freedom, where many martyrs lost their lives and thousands were injured, continues to call on us to preserve the great revolution undertaken by the great people. For this reason you need to pause with us for a moment.,,What is happening now?,,10. Judges of Egypt, we trust in you and in your authority, but there is still popular demand to put those who committed financial, political and religious corruption in Egypt on trial. We demand that those who killed the martyrs be punished swiftly and fairly in public courts, where they will see how the people take what is theirs. You are our greatest hope.,11. We demand trials for the deposed Hosni Mubarak and all those who committed corruption in trials that everyone in Egypt can see through the media. You will be clear like the sun.,12. Cut off and isolate all of ‘Atif ‘Abid, Ahmad Shafiq, and Ahmad Nazif’s men from ‘Isam Sharaf’s government, starting with the directors of the ministry offices and all others who followed and supported the defunct regime.,13.

A Day in the Life of Someone Who is Fasting,2012-01-14,2012,"A Day in the Life of Someone Who is Fasting,Ramadan Projects,,In the name of God, thanks be to him, and all praise and blessings be upon his the Messenger of God…My Dear Brother, many happy greetings this holiday season.,,Do you want to protect yourself from 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day? When you fast for one day during Ramadan, you fast for fourteen hours, roughly 50,000 seconds. So can you believe that fasting for just 50,000 seconds during Ramadan protects you from having to endure 50,000 years of thirst on Judgment Day?,,One second in Ramadan is equal to a whole year of heat and thirst on Judgment Day!!!!!,,My Dear Brother, if Ramadan passes you by, you cannot make up for it. Is it not enough that every past Ramadan in your life has already passed you by? If this happens, do not despair. Live this Ramadan as if it were the last in your life: gather your resolve and undertake these projects with us to the best of your ability:,,The How to Make a Billion in 30 Days Project?,Did you know that by reciting the entire Qur’an on any day you can gain 3.3 million blessings, if God, praise and blessings be upon him, sees fit to bestow them (i.e., they erase 3.3 million wrongdoings). The doubling of blessings in Ramadan makes the eternal rewards of any pilgrimage to Mecca equal to those of the Hajj with the Messenger of God!! So what do you think the eternal rewards of reciting the Quran in Ramadan are? Hundreds of millions of blessings are yours for the taking, so will you lose them and wish that you had a single blessing on the worst of days. If you take these blessings, you will have more than the owners of mobile phone companies and multinational groups!!,,The Kick-starting Ramadan Project:,Make your worship at the beginning of the month the most fervent part of the whole month. As soon as the first night of Ramadan begins, gather your strength so that this night be the night when you are ransomed from the fire. God willing, starting on the first night and every other night, right after you break your fast resolve to make this night the onnight when you are ransomed from the fire. “For God, may he be magnified and exalted, favors every redeemed person each day and night.” Al-Albani has verified this report. There are 60 opportunities for you to save yourself from the fire, one opportunity every day and one every night. This means that during Ramadan:,If you behave well for one night, your whole life is saved.,If you behave well for one day, your whole life is saved.,,The Ramadan Changed Me Project (the project for attending nightly prayers):,Prepare the section of the Qur’an that you will hear that night during nightly prayers by reading it in the afternoon with humility and contemplation. You will see the great difference between your humility during these prayers (because in this way you are gaining blessings twice over: once for listening during these prayers and once for reading it in the afternoon). If you are able to read the interpretation of this part of the prayers, or listen to a tape of its interpretation, then you will have obtained an experience that is rare today!!! Listening to the Qur’an is a process of mutual learning, and in this way change will truly take place during Ramadan (don’t say that it is difficult…..). An average interpretation of a section of the Qur’an is only 29 in the al-Sa’di interpretation!!,,The Keys to the Treasures of God Project:,Did you know that during Ramadan 60 of your supplications will be answered, meaning sixty problems in your life could be solved, sixty of your greatest dreams could be realized… “For each Muslim, every day and night, a supplication is answered” Al-Albani has verified this report. If the wealthiest person on earth gave you 60 blank checks — how joyous would you be?? And God the almighty, God answers sixty of your supplications, one for every day and night of Ramadan.,Change your life in half an hour: (Keep a prayer booklet in your pocket and read it beseechingly every day. Don’t lose the keys to the treasures of God in your life),,The Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) Project:,“The minor Hajj in Ramadan is like the Hajj with me.” There is no action that will bring you closer to the Prophet (peace be upon him) than performing the minor Hajj during Ramadan.,,The Increasing Income and Making It Last Project:,Do you have a problem with your daily bread? Do you want a rewarding job? Do you want a husband? Do you want children? Do you want a wife? “Whomever wants to simplify his life and extend his income shall be blessed” Do not forget to invite your family and neighbors to break the fast.,,The 30 Castles in Heaven Project:,There are not 30 castles along the North Coast, or on the coast of Hawaii, or in Nice, France but rather they are in Heaven. Every day, prostrate yourself 12 times in prayer (2 before dawn, 4 before and 2 after the afternoon prayer, 2 after sunset prayer, and 2 at the final prayer time).,,The 7 Daily Hajjs in Ramadan Project:,5 Hajjs: Did you know that if you hear the call to prayer and get up right away, perform ablutions and go to the mosque, that the reward is like a Hajj. “The reward of he who leaves his house purified to pray one of the five prayers is that of he who performs the Hajj.” Al-Albani has verified this report. “A woman will have the same reward if she is inclined to obey God and his Prophet by deciding to be satisfied with staying in her house.”,Another Hajj: “Whoever prays the Ghada “i.e., dawn” prayer with a group and then sits, reciting God’s name until the sun rises and then prays twice, will earn reward equal to he who completes a Hajj and a minor Hajj.” Al-Albani has verified this report. Simply performing this ritual would earn you reward for 30 Hajjs and minor Hajjs over the course of Ramadan.,Another Hajj: The Prophet, peace be upon him, declared that attending one lesson earns reward equal to a Hajj. Attending the evening Ramadan prayer in a mosque includes a short lesson during the prayer, which, God willing, is equivalent to a lesson. Is there a reasonable person who would waste the opportunity to perform seven Hajjs every day!!!??,,The Lost Treasure Project:,Most people waste the hour after breaking the fast, but did you know that if you read a section of the book of God over the course of a month, you would read the entire Qur’an?? So what is stopping you from reading the entire Qur’an?! A sitcom?? Or an interview with an artist??,,The Monks of the Night Project (Knights of the Vigil):,,Read this brilliant Hadith: “Verily, every night, throughout the month of Ramadan, God waits until the first part of the night is over. Then he descends to the worldly heaven and says: “Is there anyone who asks so that he may be granted his desire? Is there any who prays for forgiveness so that his sins may be forgiven? Is there any repentant so that his repentance may be accepted?”) Al-Albani has verified this report.. What is most brilliant here is that God descends every night in months other than Ramadan, according to the most famous saying, in the last third of the night. In Ramadan, God descends for the final two-thirds of the night, so most of the night in Ramadan is a wonderful opportunity to unburden yourself and receive your deepest desires. Can you afford to let this chance escape? Sleep, if you are guilty of nothing. Sleep, if you need nothing from God. Sleep, if you don’t dream of being in Paradise next to God.,,The Project of the Night of a Lifetime:,Laylat Al Qadr is twelve hours which are worth more than a thousand months..i.e., worth more than 720,000 hours, i.e., (three-quarters of a million hours)…If an hour is worth more than 60,000 hours than a single aya in the Qu’ran is worth more than 60,000 ayas, one prayer is worth more than 60,000 prayers and giving a fasting person breakfast on this day is worth feeding 60,000 fasting people on any other day. Truly..”Whoever is deprived of its good is deprived of all good,” a true Hadith. This is truly the night of a lifetime. Feed those fasting, talk to your family, even if only by phone. Settle every conflict with others, even over the phone. Read the Qur’an. Pray until your feet are cleft, like the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. The best act of worship is to forgive those who have wronged you, for the reward befits the act. “Oh God, you forgive us constantly, you love forgiveness, so forgive us.”,,The Protecting the Fast project:,For every fasting person you feed, it as if you fasted another day during Ramadan, and each day is worth ten. “If you fed 36 fasting people, it is as if you fasted 360 days, meaning you made the entire year as Ramadan.”,Don’t forget: present the Ramadan package, place a box of dates in the mosque, feed those fasting dates as you go to the mosque, give to those fasting along highways and stations with money and deeds, and you will receive the blessings of many Ramadans.,,The Da’wa Knights project:,Ramadan is the most common season for those who have sinned to seek out religion, so you must seize this opportunity. Strive, with your money and energy, to distribute religious tapes and cds to those who do not practice religion, to drivers at stations, and store-owners, and make them swear that they will listen to the tapes. Distribute small beautiful copies of the Qur’an in Ramadan on the condition that those who receive them will read them. Invite two of your friends to practice good all month, so that their good deeds may be added to your blessing.,,The Knights of Ramadan Project:,Swear to God in Ramadan that you will repent a particular sin each day and, God willing, never commit it again. On the first day, swear to give up smoking. On the second day, promise to give up all commingling with women. On the third day, swear to give up all inappropriate music…clean your cell phone and your hard drive of anything that would anger God, and so on.,“To accomplish all of this, give up using both screens during Ramadan, the internet screen and the television screen.”,,The Female Knights of Ramadan Project:,You must wear the full Hijab beginning in Ramadan, the Hijab recognized by Shari’a, i.e., the Hijab of ‘A’isha and Fatima. If you do not enter into the mercy of God while all the gates of Heaven, all the gates of mercy, and all the seven gates of Paradise are open, then when will you enter??!!,,The Intensive Care Unit Project ( I’tikaf (solitary contemplation) during the final ten days of Ramadan):,How many youth have we seen change their lives completely because of the I’tikaf (and the man writing these lines is among them). Practice I’tikaf in a mosque where there are devoted teachers to guide you through these ten days. “Adhere to I’tikaf and do not abandon it.”,,The Knights of Remembrance Project:,“Glory to God! All praise be to him! There is no God but God and God is the Greatest! They are the most dear words to God.” Each word is worth a tree in Paradise. Each word is greater to God than the Uhud mountain…Each word that ascends to the throne of God will remind God of you…Say these words at the morning prayer, and as you make your way through the day so that you do not lose their great reward.,,What about after Ramadan?!,Swear to God during the I’tikaf that you will worship regularly after Ramadan (fasting, standing for an hour each night, reciting the Qur’an daily)…Promise God that you will support Islam at every turn, until each Ramadan becomes a turning point in your relationship with God.,,Our dear Muslim friends, male and female, in the west, don’t let anything but God occupy you throughout Ramadan.

Our Vision for Exiting from the Crisis,2012-01-12,2012,"The Salafi Front in Egypt Announcement,Our Vision for Exiting from the Crisis,,Thank God, and prayers and peace upon our lord, God’s messenger, and his family and allies:,,Regarding the statement released by the Military Council on Tuesday, 22 November, the Salafi Front puts forth the following observations and suggestions:,,First: The Front emphasizes the importance of preserving the peacefulness of the revolution in its second stage, the obligation of preventing bloodshed, and the preservation of the institutions of the state and their essential structure.,,Second: The Front finds the Military Council’s statement positive from the perspective that it puts a time limit on the transfer of power to an elected civilian president—at the latest, the end of next June—but it has not put forth the necessary guarantees to achieve that. It is not enough as it has not yet met all the legitimate demands of the square. We hope the intention of this disparity is not to entrench division among those gathered in the square.,,Third: The statement did not oppose the infamous Salmi document which was among the most important reasons for the explosion of events in Egypt since the middle of last July, considering it a purely governmental affair not being included in its terms of reference.,,Fourth: The statement mentioned not a single word about the issue of the trial of the murderers from the Interior Ministry who killed protesters, neither those who fell in the events of the first revolution or in recent days.,,Fifth: The statement discounts the issue of the referendum on the continuation of military rule by its absence (i.e. the statement does not mention this referendum) which gives the impression that the Military Council is grasping for power even though it lacks legitimacy for two reasons. First, the termination of the six-month period which had been previously set for transferring power and, second, the blood which was spilled in the squares of Egypt in the recent period under its supervision.,,With this, the Salafi Front puts forward the following suggestions:,,Finally: The Salafi Front urges its children and all the Islamic and national forces to unite in Tahrir Square and all the squares of Egypt as this is the only guarantee to achieve all the demands of the revolution and the ambitions of the great Egyptian people.

"It is the Second Massacre, oh Lord of the Ka’ba",2012-01-11,2012,"It is the second massacre, oh Lord of the Ka’ba,,The first was 28 January; its main characters were Mubarak and al-’Adili,,Those who are a part of this second massacre number more than 33 martyrs and around 2000 injured, and the battle continues,,After this massacre, Field Marshal Muhammad Tantawi issued a short statement, but it was pure rhetoric, not a statement at all. He began with a consolation for the families of the martyrs, thinking that such rhetoric could bandage these families’ wounds. It is as though, in the rationale of these leaders, the blood of Egyptian men and women were cheap. They use live ammunition to kill many of the people’s sons and cause injury to others—injuries which often result in disability. Mubarak and al-’Adili were the main characters of the first massacre. Who do you think issued the orders and armed his men with live ammunition in the battle? But the uncontested heroes of this battle were the youth of Egypt who, armed with nothing more than their livers, went out to express their will: No to Dr. ‘Ali al-Silmi’s document.,,There have been many documents, but after all the violations committed against them in the ten months since the 25 January Revolution, the youths’ patience has run out.,,Throughout this period, the youths have seen no advancements that could reassure them about Egypt’s future. The fate of our dear Egypt is the responsibility of us all, and affairs inside the country and out are deteriorating at a frightening pace. Egyptian citizens have become uneasy about the future of this faithful country, and could there be any causes for this—across the length and breadth of the country—other than chaos, a lack of sovereignty, a lack of respect for the law, and a lack of justice to reassure every citizen about his future? Justice is the basis of rule.,,No to sultans, rulers, and judges whose sentences are not carried out. There is chaos across the length and breadth of the country, and prices have soared. A loaf of bread: a citizen cannot do without it, and yet he cannot get it. Oh people, have we reached a level of degradation where we cannot even get a loaf of bread?,,Whose innocent blood was spilled on the path to lifting the burden off the Egyptian people?,,Who armed the attackers? Who ordered them to fire live ammunition into the chests of Egypt’s sons? We were expecting the Field Marshal’s statement to present these criminals (who killed unarmed sons from among dear Egypt’s loyal citizens) and turn them over to the people.,,We place the responsibility for the deaths of these martyrs and their innocent blood first and foremost upon the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), in its role as the protector of all citizens in the land of Egypt. We also place responsibility on ‘Isam Sharaf’s ministry and the men of the Interior whom we saw on all the media outlets. Indeed, the entire world witnessed with us the degradation and insults faced by those who were injured, as well as the degradation of the martyrs, whose corpses were thrown into the garbage as if they were animals. Aren’t these terrible scenes… scenes that hurt every Egyptian citizen concerned for Egypt’s sons… and what crime did these martyrs commit?! All they did was exercise the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution and go out to occupy in Tahrir Square. They were steadfast and never attacked, and none of them ever carried a single stone or projectile. In other words, they were peaceful; they were expressing their discontent with the condition our dear Egypt is currently in and which is the responsibility of us all.,,Let the SCAF and ‘Isam Sharaf’s ministry know that innocent blood was not and will not rest quietly in the hearts of mothers and fathers until the criminals who murdered their sons and mutilated their corpses are brought before global general opinion, so that everyone will know that Egyptian blood is not as the criminals think; Egyptians are not rats or sheep to be offered as a sacrifice after the days of al-Adha. SCAF swore in its very first decision never to fire a single shot at the chest of any Egyptian. They pledged to transfer the country to a civilian authority after six months, a period which expired and has now been extended to the end of 2012… We are now demanding first: that the criminals and those who gave them live ammunition and ordered them to attack Egypt’s sons be brought forward with the utmost haste. This time it wasn’t Mubarak or al-’Adili, so where are the criminals? We are also demanding that a Supreme National Council composed of Egypt’s sons be formed and take on the leadership of the country until affairs are stabilized and natural life returns to our dear Egypt.,,We also say that the people haven’t chosen a single presidential candidate for Egypt, nor have they nominated a single one of them to take on the Salvation Government. There must be a savior for the country, and the people must be in unanimous agreement about his powers and abilities to save this suffering country.,,God is great; glory unto Him,,The Leader of the Popular Resistance,Hafiz Salama,,","Movements, Revolution, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141746im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled7.png,imgID513,

Together to End Military Trials and the Power of Murderers and Thieves,2012-01-09,2012,"Together to End Military Trials and the Power of Murderers and Thieves,,More than ten months after the overthrow of the deposed dictator Mubarak, who authorized his Military Council to rule the country after him, this Council has not relented in committing many cruel crimes and massacres against the general populace. Since its first day in power, this Council has been at the forefront of the counter-revolution, despite its mendacious claims to be protecting the revolution. This Council is the organic extension of Mubarak’s regime. It represents the same ruling class he represented—a class that came to the seat of power only to protect its own interests and safeguard its political regime based on political tyranny, barbaric repression, looting the homeland’s riches, and impoverishing its citizens. The savage, bloody massacre that the Military Council and its Interior Ministry are perpetrating in Tahrir Square [illegible] from Egyptian cities—a massacre that aimed to kill Egyptians and gouge out their eyes—exposes beyond any shred of a doubt the [illegible] policies inimical to the revolution and the people that this Council is undertaking.,The Democratic Workers’ Party strongly condemns this massacre and these fascist practices of military rule. We wish to make known that we stand among the ranks of the masses who have struggled from the twenty-fifth of January until now, and we have been part of the Tahrir Square sit-in since its first day. We also wish to make known that we have completely adopted the revolutionary demands that the popular masses are making in Tahrir Square and all the other squares of the country. We invite the working-class masses to join the current revolutionary [illegible] ranks that are playing their part in the struggle by using the weapon of the strike, which played the most important role in achieving the Egyptian revolution’s first victory: overthrowing Mubarak. This revolution’s aim will only be realized through the continuous struggle of the poor, popular classes—those primarily tasked with ousting all of Mubarak’s regime, starting at its roots, and creating a popular replacement power to lead the country towards a process of fundamental democratic transformation and true social justice. May our revolutionary struggle continue until it achieves:,,- The immediate return of the Military Council to their barracks, keeping them from playing any political role or participating in governance.,,- The immediate resignation of Sharaf’s government and the formation of a revolutionary government to manage the transitional period. Together with the revolutionary forces, this government would propose new programs to the masses packed into the squares, with a guarantee for [illegible] complete popular oversight of its practices through elected popular committees. This government would also be given all the necessary powers of legitimate, political management appropriate for uprooting the corrupt and [illegible] of Mubarak’s regime and to return the country to a process of democratic transition, achieving the pressing goals of social justice, such as minimum and maximum wage limits.,,- Bringing those leaders of the Interior Ministry and the police who are responsible for the current [illegible] before an immediate revolutionary tribunal and granting fair recompense to the martyrs and the wounded.,,- A restructuring of the Interior Ministry to purge it of the corrupt, murderous, blood-hungry leaders, because a civilian political minister must be put in charge of it.,,- The immediate release of all those arrested in the Tahrir sit-in and all political prisoners.,,- The immediate termination of military trials for civilians and the release of those held in custody while awaiting trial. Their sentences should be overturned, and those convicted should be re-tried before regular civilian judges.,,- The termination of the undemocratic legislation that the Military Council has passed, such as the laws criminalizing strikes and the political parties’ law.,,The continuous co-presence of the struggling masses in their battle against the forces of oppression, cruelty, looting, and impoverishment is the only way to continue on the path toward revolution… Together to end military trials and the power of murderers and thieves.,,Our revolution lives on, continuous until victory.,Glory to the martyrs.,,The Democratic Workers’ Party,21 November 2011,,","Military, Military Tribunals, Other Parties, Politics, Solidarity",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130141310im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled5.png,imgID515,

The main reason for this destruction, these disasters is the oppression and corruption of our rulers, leaders and religious scholars. They are the ones who pillaged all that is beautiful in these lands. But destruction and disaster will also come from the injustice of the people themselves, because they have remained silent about the rulers’ corruption and unjust practices.,,My Egyptian Brother, did you know….,… that Israel and America want to change this world so that the countries of the East and even the whole world become slaves for Israel and America? These are the people who also want to destroy the Islamic ‘Umma in all the nations of the East and other countries. They have sown such dissension between the peoples of of the East that these peoples no longer know who is truly the worst enemy of all Islamic countries.,,So, my Brother Egypt, rise up….,Whether you are “Muslim or Christian”, rise up and save Egypt as you would save yourself from other dangers. You yourself must choose who will help Egypt advance and develop. Know that God does not love anyone who remains silent in the face of injustice, and that He loves those who pursue justice. It is your right, my Egyptian Brother, to say “No” to all forms of injustice, whatever they may be. Do not be afraid to do what’s right, and do not fear that those who are guilty will blame you. Know, my Egyptian Brother, that whoever dies or meets his end while reforming the nation is a martyr, and every martyr will go to Heaven.

However, God the Almighty protected him from these evil-doers and revealed to him some of the secrets that are important for the people of the world in righting all that is happening.

"Revolt, Revolt, Dear Country… No Tantawi, No Ganzuri!",2012-01-05,2012,"Revolt, revolt, dear country… no Tantawi, no Ganzuri!,,The land screams revolution… and the military summons the remnants of Mubarak’s regime.,,Birds of a feather flock together.,,After a long search through the old folders and files of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and the remnants of the ousted president’s regime, the ruling Council made its decision arbitrarily and forcefully, finding no one better than Kamal al-Ganzuri for the task of forming a new government.,,Kamal Ahmad al-Ganzuri is accused in the number one legal case of 2011 for granting land in the Toshka valley—to which he hadn’t the slightest legitimate claim—to al-Walid Ibn Talal Ibn ‘Abd al-’Aziz. al-Ganzuri is the prime minister who directed the sale of the public sector and left the ministry with a deficit exceeding twelve billion dollars in the trade balance. He is the prime minister who, during his two-year term from1997-1999, succeeded in increasing local debt to 200 billion Egyptian pounds (EGP). He was accused of illegally withdrawing 500 billion EGP to block the government’s deficit without official permission, and headed up the ministry that embraced the most brazen symbols of corruption and oppression. Some of them are in prison, and others in wait.,,From 25 January until this very moment, hundreds of thousands of revolutionaries have been struggling against oppression, poverty, and the disgrace of military rule. They fight for freedom, against al-’Adili’s crimes, random arrests, and the use of torture in police stations and the Interior Ministry headquarters. They fight against absolving the murders that took place before and after 25 January; they struggle for the reprisal of the martyrs of January, February, Maspero, and November in public revolutionary trials which seek justice for those killed by bullets or crushed by armored vehicles, and for those who lost their eyes for the sake of the revolution’s success.,,From 25 January until this very moment, revolutionaries, students, workers, and young professionals have struggled to live and fight for social justice, for an honest bite of bread, for minimum and maximum wages, for their right to reclaim the country’s resources as guaranteed to them by a court ruling which the military government has refused to implement. They fight for social security and retirement, to support a decent life for those who spent theirs serving the country.,,From 25 January until this very moment, the autocratic regime that was represented by Mubarak until 11 February, and then by the Military Council headed by Tantawi, has been desperately intent on exterminating the revolution. In the beginning, they tried to contain it, but this containment failed because of their greed and the greed of their agents and allies, with whom they formed a corrupt alliance of authority and capitalism. They spewed democratic rhetoric while they filled the prisons with thousands of youths, the majority of whom are poor and were given illegitimate military trials, and they welcomed those describing themselves as liberals with legislation criminalizing sit-ins and strikes. They call out “Civilian!” but hold the bloodied hands of the military.,,Today, Ganzuri will begin his task as prime minister of the military, and his era begins with the killing of the martyr Ahmad Sayyid Surur, who was protesting in front of the parliament. Today, the blood of the martyrs will flow yet again to water the revolution’s land, the squares of freedom throughout Egypt. The demands remain the same: bread, freedom, and social justice. It’s as if the Council rules from another planet, searching through the registers of the old regime’s remnants and choosing Kamal al-Ganzuri from among them, in a desperate attempt to return the country to the way it was before 25 January. Having felt the degradation of their ignored demands, and having paid an exorbitant price, the masses have only become more resolved never to give up the revolution, and they will boycott the elections that—despite the blood and murder—continue to whet the appetite of opportunists.,,We are where the masses are.,So we will stay in the squares in order to remove the Military Council, and for the sake of a revolutionary government that will achieve what the people have been revolting for: bread, freedom, and social justice.,Down with the Military Council!

The Revolutionary Socialists: To the Workers of Egypt,2012-01-04,2012,"To the workers of Egypt, rise up for the victory of the revolution and the revolutionaries!,,Almost a year after our glorious revolution which toppled the dictator, the regime of repression, oppression, and corruption remains, now under the leadership of the military council, which imposes itself by force in an attempt to erase the traces of the revolution and deprive the poor and toiling masses from reaping the fruits of their great struggle. The repressive regime which the military has preserved imagines that the revolution is over and done with, and that the people who rose up last January to break the dreadful instruments of repression would surrender today in the face of tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition.,,The masses who now confront death for the sake of saving the revolution are confronting the remains of the criminal regime, and they will be victorious as they were before. The instruments of repression which were broken on 28 January will be broken again by the revolutionaries’ will. This regime has effectively proven that it is nothing more than the distorted continuation of Mubarak’s totalitarian regime. Today, this regime resists the return of the companies that plundered in the Mubarak era through privatization. The military council continues to protect the privileges which Mubarak afforded to elite investors. Mubarak partisans circumvent the minimum wage which workers sought for the sake of a dignified life, while prices rise insanely. The union freedom laws continue to be restrained and the criminal killing of revolutionaries in cold blood at the hands of Mubarak’s executioners continues today at the hands of military rule.,,Workers mobilized last February to rescue the revolution. They carried out labor strikes in all corners of Egypt with the support of the revolution: Cairo, Mahalla, Suez and Alexandria caught fire. Workers in every governorate of Egypt—in factories and in public and private institutions—led the obligation to resist. They forced the dictator to surrender when strikes paralyzed the the regime’s joints and threatened to implode it, so the regime decided to save itself by sacrificing its president.,,Today, the revolution will not be deceived again and will not accept pacification. The working class that secured victory in February will not delay to rescuing those heroes of the revolution who are resisting the corrupt and repressive regime again today. Workers who occupied companies in January will seek to occupy them soon. The workers who headed to the public squares will head there again.

Our Union is Our Weapon,2012-01-02,2012,"[cover],Our Union is Our Weapon,We want to build it right,,Popular Socialist Alliance Party,,[page 1],,Why do we want a union?,,Workers have discovered that after the strike ends (especially if their demands were addressed) they will need a way to stay more connected. A ready weapon they can use any time to hang onto the rights they won. Something around which they can organize; something they can use to demand other rights. A tool that can help them negotiate and decide what to do next. And when the boss doesn’t grant a demand or tries to take away one of their rights, the union is a way of gathering them together and uniting their ranks for a new battle.,,They stole unions from us,Egyptian workers on their own were able to build strong unions that defended their rights and demanded higher wages. When a worker was fired, his fellow workers showed solidarity by organizing a regional strike against the abuse of firing workers. These unions were strong in Egypt until the early fifties, when the government decided to break up worker unity by taking control of the weapon that made them strong. Instead of helping workers defend their rights, unions became a means of dividing them—a weapon in the hands of the state and company bosses. The members of these unions became a part of the regime whose goal was to drain workers’ blood.,The government did all this by founding the Egyptian Trade Union Federation in 1957. Its hierarchical structure gave all decision-making powers to the federation president and union heads. The government forced all trade unions to join the federation, thereby allowing it to control the unions by taking away their independence. The unions separated from the working masses and became unions in name only—a far cry from gaining rights for workers. The unions’ condition continued to worsen until workers woke up again.,,[page 2],,The union’s role,So why does the government try to shatter our strength? Why does it set up roadblocks to forming any popular organization, whether it’s a party, a union, or even a people’s collective or human rights organization? When we do manage to surmount these obstacles, why do they insist on controlling us? The answer is that it’s in the interest of those who exploit us and those who help them with their laws and policies to keep us weak and in an ‘every man for himself’ situation. If we were strong, we’d demand our stolen rights and fight against the policies that aim to destroy us and our lives at little cost—policies such as privatization, low wages, and unemployment. We’d demand our right to free health care, a fair minimum wage, insurance, and more.,Unions allow us to make a move as an organized group, hands linked against the bosses. They allow us to demand our right to sufficient wages, an eight-hour work day with an hour break, guarantees against arbitrary firing, health insurance and social security. This is why they don’t want us to have this weapon.,,The union is for workers not against them,About four years ago, workers began to take back the unions. When the real estate tax-collectors organized a sit-in to demand their rights, the union that was supposed to defend them stood in their way, telling them they had no rights. The same thing happened to workers at Masr Spinning and Weaving in Mahalla, and in many other factories and companies.,When the Mahalla workers and tax-collectors realized their demands through protest, they saw that these unions were not their own and could not be reformed from the inside. They decided to try something new. The Mahalla workers requested to withdraw from their union. But the real estate tax-collectors decided to build a totally new union outside the trade federation, despite the fact that…,[page 3],… the Egyptian government and its labor law (in violation of the constitution and international agreements signed by Egypt) didn’t recognize their union. However, the International Trade Union Confederation recognized them after tireless efforts, and three more independent unions followed in their footsteps. After the 25 January revolution, it rained trade unions as workers helped shape the Egyptian people’s destiny.,,The true union is a weapon,But if unions are to succeed, they must be properly built. They must be built in a way that keeps them from being stolen from us again, and that prevents anyone from using them to break us apart or turning them into facades rather than weapons for our rights.,First of all, the unions must be made up of workers. No decision should be made without the consent of every desk and warehouse. This means that the assembly of rank-and-file members must reflect workers and employees from all kinds of workplaces. They must know their problems and ask about their opinions. The union must always tell them everything they agree on and take their views into consideration in all their planning. Most importantly, the union must take its legitimacy from the workers. Nothing but workers’ actions will gain workers’ rights.,These unions must also be democratic in all decision-making and elections, in other words the governing assembly should never be allowed to make decisions through any process other than what the workers dictate. The workers’ association determines plans, actions and demands, and it elects the assembly and any other committees.,Unions must be independent, and should not be bound to any authority other than their workers. In an independent union, all plans originate with the public association and with its members. No one can impose anything from outside…,,[page 4],whether it’s the government or any party or organization. Only an independent union can articulate its workers’ positions and needs. It doesn’t discriminate between workers on any basis—they’re all equal as far as rights and obligations are concerned.,Also, the right union has to be a model of struggle. Yes, we’ll negotiate for our rights, but we keep the weapon of resistance raised high so the administration always understands that this union has the power to assemble its workers for their rights at any time, in any way.,,Unions and the revolution,Of course building these unions isn’t easy; it’ll require a lot of effort. But this is how the unions will remain a weapon in the hands of their united workers. We’re in a new moment. A revolution happened in our country, and workers participated in it in different ways. It was a popular revolution, and this ought to have some effect on the lives of workers and the poor. Of course until now, basically nothing has changed for workers. Wages haven’t increased and prices haven’t dropped, nor have the corrupt been deposed. Worse, the workers’ movement to demand their rights (on the assumption that the people made the revolution happen) has been criminalized by laws whose like we haven’t seen in any era. Enemies of the revolution knew where the revolution’s real power came from, so they started a war on the workers and the poor, because the revolution’s success is in their hands.,In sum, we’re at war. Either we keep our revolution and start reaping the benefits of our sacrifices, or we lose everything including the weapon that we built.,We can say the revolution won’t succeed until we arm ourselves correctly. As long as the fight inside the factory has no relationship to what happens in the streets, the union won’t have a true meaning in workers’ lives.,[back cover],,We must understand that the fight is everywhere, and all the partisans have one goal: the right to form unions is just like the right to form parties. A clean ballot box is like a clean loaf of bread or unpolluted water. The right to health insurance is as important as the right to a dignified existence without political arrests or torture.,,Contact Us:,,The Popular Socialist Alliance Party,Offices:,,Central: 71 Nubar St. – Bab al-Luq – First floor,Phone: [redacted],Cairo: al-Awqaf Residences, in front of Dome Gardens Neighborhood – Block 5, Apt. 6,Alexandria: 89 Memphis St. – al-Ibrahimiyya – First floor, Apt. 8,Isma’iliyya: 96 30th St. – First floor,al-Daqhaliyya: 5 Salah Salim St. – Khafaji Tower – Sixth floor,,Website: http://egyleftparty.org,Or our Facebook page: “Popular Alliance” (al-Tahaluf al-Sha’bi),www.facebook.com/popular.alliance.party,,","Unions, Workers",https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130152332im_/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled19.png,imgID522,
